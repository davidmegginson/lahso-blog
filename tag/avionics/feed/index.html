<p>Today I flew my plane home from <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYKF/">Waterloo</a> to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Ottawa</a> with a brand-new autopilot installed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve flown over 850 hours, about 120 of them in actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_meteorological_conditions">instrument conditions</a>, and all by hand.  I&#8217;m proud that I can do that, but at the same time, it&#8217;s tiring: after 8 hours bumping around in cumulus clouds and dodging storms on the Stormscope, I&#8217;m exhausted beyond anything I&#8217;d ever imagined.  Even 4 hours in good VFR weather can be tiring, because of the constant attention needed to keep the plane straight, level, and on course.</p>
<h2>Choosing an upgrade</h2>
<p>I knew it was time to improve rather than just maintain my plane, and I also considered an IFR GPS and a new paint job (both about the same cost), but the autopilot gave me the biggest safety and operational benefits for the money.  I called a few places for quotes, but the only one that answered my calls and questions consistently was <a href="http://www.kitcheneraero.com/">Kitchener Aero</a>, where owner Barry Aylward went out of his way to carry on a friendly e-mail and phone correspondence for half a year while I hemmed and hawed, then fit me right in as soon as I made up my mind, as if I were one of his bizjet customers rather than a tight-fisted Cherokee owner.</p>
<p>I decided on the <a href="http://www.s-tec.com/Documentation/Shared%20Documents/Product%20Brochures/sys_20-30.pdf">S-TEC System 20</a>, a rate-based autopilot (much smoother and more reliable than old APs) that is built into a turn coordinator, and replaces that instrument on my panel without needing any extra space.  The S-TEC 20 is a <em>single-axis</em> autopilot &mdash; that means that it controls roll (and heading), but not pitch (and altitude) or yaw.  Barry warned me that I&#8217;d wish I&#8217;d paid a few thousand extra for the S-TEC 30 with altitude hold, but I was already close to my spending limit, and knew I&#8217;d end up asking for extra maintenance work on my existing avionics (and a new <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp13918-tp13918-5309.htm">406 MHz ELT</a>, since the plane was there anyway &#8230;).</p>
<h2>Using the autopilot</h2>
<p>Kitchener Aero sent me up on a test flight with one of its people, ready to adjust the autopilot, but it was absolutely perfectly tuned.  While the S-TEC 20 can&#8217;t hold an altitude, here&#8217;s what it <em>can</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the wings level, and allow simple, stable turns using a knob (without risk of overbanking).</li>
<li>Track a heading set on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_indicator">heading indicator</a>.</li>
<li>Track a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range">VOR</a> radial inbound or outbound.</li>
<li>Track a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localizer">localizer</a> on a LOC or ILS approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to try all of these during the test flight northwest of Waterloo (except for the LOC tracking, due to a miscommunication with Waterloo tower).  Unlike GPS tracks, VOR needles tend to <em>scallop</em> &mdash; wag back and forth &mdash; and an autopilot that overreacts to that will soon make the passengers (and pilot) seasick with all the rocking.  The S-TEC 20 responded very gently, and almost unnoticeably, to the scalloping, even close to the VOR.</p>
<h2>First cross-country with an autopilot</h2>
<p>During my flight home, I had a chance to use both modes for a bit over two hours.  I used VOR-tracking mode to track northeast outbound from Waterloo, then heading mode (with frequent adjustments) to fly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment">DME</a> arc just outside Toronto terminal airspace until I could join my airways, then back to VOR-tracking mode as I followed the airways and switched from VOR to VOR.  Up at 9,500 ft, above the broken layer of cumulus cloud, the air was smooth as silk, and I was able to fly hands off with only an adjustment every 5 minutes or so to the elevator trim to hold altitude.  Barry was wrong &mdash; I wasn&#8217;t missing altitude hold at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, summer is summer, and eventually, the cloud layer <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/07/the-summer-flying-dilemma/">rose up to meet me</a>.  I had to descend down below it, and my nice smooth flight became a mechanical rodeo bull.  The autopilot still did a good job holding heading and tracking the VORs, though the turns in turbulence were more aggressive and noticeable, but I found myself trimming every 30 seconds or so as my pitch and altitude shot up and down in rising and falling air columns.  Barry was right &mdash; in the turbulence, I wished I had altitude hold.  </p>
<p>The good news is that the S-TEC 20 can easily be upgraded to an S-TEC 30, which <em>does</em> support altitude hold and electric trim.  Maybe in a year or two.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>I think the autopilot is going to be a big part of my flying from now on.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed the bragging rights of always hand-flying, but 9 years of bragging is enough.  Besides, if flying is less tiring, maybe I&#8217;ll do more of it, and travel further: the prairies, the Arctic, the Mississippi, even the Florida Keys and the West Coast are all out there waiting for me.</p>
