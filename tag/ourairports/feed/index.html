According to Google translate, each comment begins something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Other ways to protest that a person can do. </p>
<p>Libyan people using violence to overcome violence, ONLY NEW VIOLENCE AGAINST THE VIOLENCE. </p>
<p>Please all the people of Vietnam Hero follow Libyan people: </p>
<p>Gasoline burn all government buildings, the gas plants, the tank cars carrying fuel, the homes of Communist Party members Hunting Dogs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Each comment then goes on to provide detailed instructions with different ways of making and using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail">Molotov cocktails</a>.  My approach to comment moderation on OurAirports is fairly permissive &mdash; I&#8217;m happy to leave in comments with strong language, political views, or even scammers trying to defend themselves (it&#8217;s fun to see other commenters take them down).  I will not, however, allow comments encouraging violence, and even more importantly, I won&#8217;t allow comments that include weapon-making instructions.</p>
<p>In a wonderful bit of unintended irony, each comment ends like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The U.S. government declared, would send U.S. troops to guard the people&#8217;s protests, the people in countries with rebel demands to overthrow dictatorships.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States &mdash; saviour of the Vietnamese people?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seasons greetings, fellow geo-geeks!  Here&#8217;s my problem.  Right now, I have organized <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> like this:</p>
<pre>
world : continent *
continent : country *
country : region *
region : airport *
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of neat data structure that people like me love, but that never quite works.  First of all, not every country is divided into regions (provinces/states/etc.) and I don&#8217;t always know what region an airport is in, but I deal with that by adding an &#8220;Unassigned&#8221; pseudo-region to every country.</p>
<p>More importantly, not every country belongs to a single continent.  The most obvious exceptions are Russia and Turkey, both of which span Europe and Asia, but there may be others that I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>So here are my questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there any countries besides Russia and Turkey that span more than one continent?</li>
<li>Are there any subdivisions of the above countries that span more than one continent?  For example, does Turkey have a province, or does Russia have an oblast that lies in both Asia and Europe?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out if I can link regions to continents, or if I have do have a link from every single airport.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>You can see where members live, and if there are any at airports near you (or near where you plan to travel to).  Zoom in to see more members (there are about 750 members in total).</p>
<p>These are based on the home airports specified in members&#8217; profiles.  It&#8217;s nice to see lots outside North America.</p>

That&#8217;s a milestone I&#8217;ve been watching for ever since I set &#8230; <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2008/12/05/40000-airports/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, Virginia, there are more than 40,000 airports in the world!  Thanks to our <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/stats/contributors.html">contributors</a>, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> now lists more than 40,000 airports, heliports, and seaplane bases around the world.  That&#8217;s a milestone I&#8217;ve been watching for ever since I set up the site.</p>
<p>I also think it&#8217;s cool that over 5,000 of those airports have actually been visited by at least one OurAirports member &mdash; that&#8217;s 13% coverage, just from the members of one little web site.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the recent contributions have been for airports outside North America, where public data sources are sparse &mdash; we now list over 3,500 airports for <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/BR/">Brazil</a> for example (more than <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/CA/">Canada</a>), nearly 1,700 for <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/AU/">Australia</a>, and 422 for <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/ZA/">South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>I know there must be lots more out there &mdash; a country as large as <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/RU/">Russia</a> is unlikely to have only 311 airports, and even the little <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/FK/">Falkland Islands</a> are supposed to have a landing strip in every settlement, so we&#8217;re missing at least 20-30 strips there.</p>
<p>If you have or can find information, please share.  Everything you contribute to OurAirports is free for anyone to use (<em>free</em> as in &#8220;beer&#8221; and &#8220;speech&#8221;), and you can <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/data/">download daily data dumps</a> for use in your own projects, so you&#8217;re sharing information with the whole community, not locking it up in a single site.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have added an experimental, alpha-quality feature to OurAirports: local Canadian Airport NOTAMs via RSS (scraped from the Nav Canada web site).  If anyone is interested in trying this out, you need to visit a Canadian airport&#8217;s page on the site and add &#8220;notams.rss&#8221; to the end of the URL, e.g.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/</a></p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/notams.rss">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/<strong>notams.rss</strong></a></p>
<p>You can subscribe to this RSS 2.0 feed using any standard blog reader,such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, filter and mash it up using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a>, etc.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>The huge advantage of reading NOTAMs in a blog reader is that your reader remembers which ones you&#8217;ve already read.  That way, when you plan a flight, you don&#8217;t have to reread the 20 NOTAMs you read for your flight three days ago.  If a NOTAM has been modified, then it will appear as unread again.</p>
<p>Nav Canada and the FAA <em>should</em> deliver NOTAMs this way automatically, as an cheap, easy way to improve flight safety &mdash; it&#8217;s too easy to miss one important new NOTAM when reading through 20 old, stale ones for the umteenth time.</p>
</div>
<div id="caveats">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Please read these &mdash; some of them are safety-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is just an experiment, not a regular feature: I may either drop it or change the way it works at any time, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to build a production-grade web app that relies on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airport NOTAMs only: FIC and HQ NOTAMs are not (yet) included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These NOTAMs are scraped from Nav Canada, so any minor change in the way they format their web pages could break the system completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These may not be up to date, and some NOTAMs may be missing, so unfortunately, you still have to go to the official source before an actual flight; however, this feed will help you keep up to date from day to day on what&#8217;s happening in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger airports have their own Nav Canada NOTAM files, but smaller airports are collected together into larger files.  You&#8217;ll see the whole file for each airport, not just the specific airport you requested (that&#8217;s a design choice).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I overhauled the search system in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> to use Google&#8217;s free <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html#Geocoding_Direct">geocoding service</a>.  <var>Geocoding</var> takes an address like &#8220;Algonquin Park&#8221; or &#8220;1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC&#8221; and converts it to a latitude and longitude &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it completely changes the way you can use OurAirports.</p>
<p>Previously, you could search for a town or city in OurAirports only if that city had an airport; for example, you could find Smiths Falls, Ontario, but not Perth, Ontario.  With geocoding, OurAirports shows the closest airports to <em>any address</em>, and that&#8217;s now the default search mode.  You can also filter the search results to show only airports with scheduled airline service, only seaplane bases, etc.</p>
<p>For example, for a <strong>commercial air traveler</strong>, here are <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/search?q=grand+canyon&amp;mode=geo&amp;show=scheduled">the closest airline airports to the Grand Canyon</a>; for a film-star bush pilot, here are the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/search?q=Hollywood%2C+California&amp;mode=geo&amp;show=seaplane">closest seaplane bases to Hollywood, California</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more information, and many more examples, on the new <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/help/searching.html">search help page</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, the name in the title sucks, but the good news is that <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> is now open to community contributions: any member can add a new airport or edit information about an existing one.</p>
<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re logged into your account (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/signup.html">sign up here</a>), you will now see an &#8220;edit&#8221; tab on every airport page, and an &#8220;<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/create.html">add a new airport</a>&#8221; link at the bottom of the left sidebar.</p>
<h2>Think locally</h2>
<p>OurAirports has excellent coverage for Canada, the U.S., and Brazil, but even then, we&#8217;re missing hundreds or thousands of private, unregistered landing fields.  For other countries, the coverage is uneven, and errors and missing information always need correction.  Now, if you live in Australia (for example), you can add missing Ozzie airports and correct or add information to existing ones, to make the site more useful for your fellow local pilots.</p>
<h2>Checking changes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m keeping an individual change history for each airport, and can roll back any changes that look spammy or wrong.  An amalgamated list of changes for all airports in inverse chronological order is available on the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/changes.html">site-wide change page</a> (also available as an <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/changes.rss">RSS feed</a>), and I&#8217;ll be grateful for help watching for any problems.  I also plan to add Wikipedia-style watchlists soon, so that you can be alerted about changes on airports that interest you.</p>
<h2>Open data</h2>
<p>Remember that I won&#8217;t hoard your contributions &mdash; the site&#8217;s full airport list, with data, is available in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/data/">CVS format for free, Public Domain download</a>, and updated every night.</p>
<h2>Unlike airport security &#8230;</h2>
<p>I plan to keep things simple and open as long as our community is small and there aren&#8217;t any serious spam attacks.  In the future, I can add moderation, recaptchas, etc. if necessary, but I don&#8217;t want to worry too much about problems that don&#8217;t actually exist yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve expanded my original <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> tagging to include all airports of entry and U.S. landing rights airports that I can find under Canadian or U.S. control.  You can now use my tag &#8220;customs&#8221; to find either, for trip planning purposes.  Here&#8217;s the map zoomed in on the Vancouver/Seattle area, showing only airports where you can clear customs:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/customs/#lat=48.58932584966972,lon=-122.36572265625,zoom=6,type=Map,member=david,tag=customs">Map of customs airports near Vancouver and Seattle</a></p>
<p>Zoom out and drag to see other parts of Canada and the U.S., or start with the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/customs/">full customs map</a>.</p>
<p>Note that some airports have only seasonal service and/or limited operating hours, and that U.S. &#8220;landing rights&#8221; airports sometimes charge a fee for customs services.  I have not included CANPASS-only airports on the map, because they are available only to pilots who have preregistered in the CANPASS program.  I have also excluded unofficial (but frequently-used) customs airports like <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-K89N/">Maxson Field</a> and <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-KANJ/">Sanderson Field</a> that are located near border crossings.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2008/06/20/tagging-airports/">previous post</a>, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> now lets you invent your own tags for airports and view maps of the airports you&#8217;ve tagged.  This morning, I made a map of 60 of the airports that were part of the <a href="">British Commonwealth Air Training Plan</a> (BCATP):</p>
<p><strong>Map:</strong> <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/bcatp/">http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/bcatp/</a></p>
<p>You can drag the map around and zoom in to see specific areas (Eastern Ontario was especially dense).  The map (which is still missing a few airports) shows how much the BCATP shaped aviation in Canada &mdash; while it used existing airfields when possible, many of the fields were built specifically for the plan, and most of those are still operational.  Some still have original hangar buildings, and many maintain the original triangle of three runways that&#8217;s so typical of Canadian airports (often with one extended to handle light jets).</p>
<p>While Canada was chosen because of its safe distance from combat and easy access to fuel, wartime flight training was still a brutal business in the BCATP &mdash; you could expect at least one fatality in every class training in planes like the Tiger Moth pictured above. Little <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CA-0013/">RCAF Pennfield Ridge</a>, for example, lost 61 student pilots and instructors during its three or four years of operation as a navigational and operational school.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a>, you can now tag airports any way you want, rather than just marking them as visited, and see a map for any tag.  Here are two examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/airport-of-entry/">Canadian customs airports of entry</a> (my tag &#8220;airport-of-entry&#8221;) <ins>Update: expanded to include U.S. airports of entry as well</ins></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/instrument-approach/">Airports where I&#8217;ve done an instrument approach in actual IMC</a> (my tag &#8220;instrument-approach&#8221;)</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to be logged in to use this feature, then you&#8217;ll see a tags option in the right sidebar on each airport page.  You can tag airports you&#8217;ve visited in different years or flying different planes; airports with good restaurants or flight schools; or anything else you want.  Each tag is a single word, or a series of words connected by &#8216;-&#8216;, &#8216;.&#8217;, or &#8216;_&#8217;, e.g. &#8216;fuel-stop&#8217;, &#8216;club-member&#8217;, &#8216;fees&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>On the TODO list: rename a tag, to export tags to KML (for Google Earth), show most popular tags on each airport page.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> is getting better at filtering.  While the maps still show everything, you can now filter most of the lists to show any of the following:</p>

<p>When pilots think of an airport, they think of anywhere they can safely and legally land their planes.  It might or might not have a a fence, pavement, fuel pumps, or any structures at all (even an outhouse), much less a terminal building with departure gates and a security checkpoint.</p>
<p>When non-pilots think of an airport, they usually think of somewhere they can buy a ticket and get on a plane.  Even in a small city, it will usually have an overpriced parking lot, paved runways, an ugly terminal building, fuel trucks, etc. etc.</p>
<h2>Have it your way &#8230;</h2>
<p>I want to make <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> useful for both groups of people, so I&#8217;ve been scavenging information on the web to flag which of the 33,000+ airports currently in the database have <em>any</em> kind of scheduled airline service (even in a light piston twin).  The roughly 3,000 airports that I&#8217;ve found with airline service are now flagged in the database, and have a small note at the top of their right sidebars.  Soon, I&#8217;ll make changes so that people who want to see <em>only</em> airports with airline service can filter out everything else.</p>
<p>This stuff changes all the time, and my sources might not be entirely reliable, so please send me corrections etc.</p>
<h2>CSV format change</h2>
<p>NB: for anyone using the CSV data export at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/data/airports.csv">http://www.ourairports.com/data/airports.csv</a>, the format will be changing as of tomorrow, adding an extra column &#8220;scheduled_service&#8221; with the value &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.  As far as I know, this is the only free, machine-readable dataset with this information available online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, Google Maps quietly added a <em>Terrain</em> layer to their maps.  I&#8217;ve enabled that in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> now, so that you can get at least a rough idea of the terrain around an airport (or in a region, country, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYHE/#lat=49.3683,lon=-121.498,zoom=10,type=Terrain,airport=CYHE">here&#8217;s why there are so many accidents around Hope, BC</a> when the weather gets low.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[OurAirports now includes heliports and floatplane bases as well as fixed-wing airports: in the last 24 hours I&#8217;ve added 828 floatplane bases and 5,911 heliports, all from Canada and the U.S. (and a couple of U.S. dependencies like Guam).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a></strong> now includes heliports and floatplane bases as well as fixed-wing airports: in the last 24 hours I&#8217;ve added 828 floatplane bases and 5,911 heliports, all from Canada and the U.S. (and a couple of U.S. dependencies like Guam).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of a map of the Vancouver area &mdash; you should be able to make out 3 floatplane bases, 7 heliports, and 6 airports (you can jump to the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/big-map.html#lat=49.14758022506841,lon=-122.75848388671875,zoom=10,type=Map">live map</a> to explore further):</p>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.plews.ca/AirportsinCanada.htm">George Plews</a> for collecting the Canadian data.  Does anyone have a good reference for heliports and floatplane bases outside of Canada and the U.S. (or even for more fixed-wing airports)?</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Ottawa Rockcliffe</a> or <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KTEB/">Teterboro</a> to see some examples, then mark some of the spots at your local airport so that I&#8217;ll know where to park, fuel up, and eat next time I fly in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like Google Maps, OurAirports now has a couple of easy ways to include your personal airport map in a blog posting or web page, YouTube-style: (easy) Click on the &#8220;Share this map&#8221; link at the top right of the &#8230; <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2007/08/21/ourairports-map-on-your-blog-or-web-page/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like Google Maps, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> now has a couple of easy ways to include your personal airport map in a blog posting or web page, YouTube-style:</p>
<ol>
<li>(easy) Click on the &#8220;Share this map&#8221; link at the top right of the map, then copy and paste the single line of HTML markup into your blog or web page.</li>
<li>(slightly more advanced) Use the KML link (also provided) to integrate with Google Earth, Google Maps, or other KML-enabled applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s my current pilot map (it might not show up in RSS readers).  OurAirports will keep it up to date even after I make my posting:</p>
<p>If you want to make your embedded map a different size, just edit the values of the <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> attributes near the start of the line of HTML.</p>
