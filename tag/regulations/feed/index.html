										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a six month break from flying &mdash; basically, work, a long wait for new fuel caps at my annual, and a family vacation in London (UK) got in the way.  I also managed to prove the third rule of aviation (after the <em>large-fortune</em> and <em>old-bold pilots</em> ones):</p>
<blockquote><p>
You can have enough time to fly, or enough money to fly, but not both.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>Changes in work</h2>
<p>Consulting work has been wonderful crazy busy for me and pretty-much every other consultant I know, whether in IT, business, aid work, development, or what-have-you.  Canada barely got brushed by the recession that devastated the US in 2008-09 (with record-high property prices in most of our big cities, it may be that our bubble just hasn&#8217;t burst yet).  The problem is that my customers are mostly in Canada and the UK now &mdash; the US economy isn&#8217;t so great, remember &mdash; so I don&#8217;t have work excuses to fly down to Boston, NYC, Washington, etc. like I used to.</p>
<h2>Recency Lost</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never taken such a long break before.  After six months away from flying, bad things start to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&#8217;t fly IFR, because you have to have done six hours real/simulated IMC and six approaches within the last six months (the infamous 6-6-6).</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t carry passengers at night, because you have to have done five takeoffs and landings at night within the last six months.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t carry passengers during the day, even other pilots, because you have to have done five takeoffs and landings (any time) within the last six months.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recency Regained (part 1)</h2>
<p>So now it&#8217;s a matter of crawling my way out of the hole, milestone by milestone, until I can get back to my regular IFR/cross-country kind of flying.  I started by calling my flying buddy Mike Hopkinson and asking for an intervention, and he complied by texting me last Saturday to remind me to get to the @#$% airport and then meeting me after his shift on dispatch.  I uncovered the plane, made some stupid mistakes trying to start it (yes, it does help to check the fuel cutoff), recharged the battery that I drained, then did my normal post-maintenance checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long, thorough preflight, including control movements.</li>
<li>Confirm that the engine compartment is clean (I even took a picture for before/after comparison).</li>
<li>Do a 5-minute lean ground-runup, and watch for anomalies.</li>
<li>Do a high-speed taxi down the runway to check what happens as the controls become effective.</li>
<li>Shut down and search for stains, leaks, cracks, or anything else that shouts <strong>DON&#8217;T FLY!</strong></li>
<li>Start up again and fly circuits, always within gliding distance of the runway.</li>
<li>Shut down and repeat the stain/leak/crack checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plane passed with flying colours (so to speak &mdash; my paint scheme is drab), and I managed five touch-and-go landings in a crisp cross-wind, progressing from &#8220;what-the-hell-was-that?&#8221; on the first to &#8220;now I&#8217;ll gently lower the nosewheel exactly on the centreline&#8221; on the fifth.  It turns out the the rules make sense &mdash; 5 really is the magic number, and now I was legal to carry passengers in day VFR.</p>
<h2>Victory lap to Toronto and back</h2>
<p>As soon as I was done that and mentioned it on Facebook, my older daughter asked me if I could pick her up in Toronto and bring her home for a break from her studies at U of T.  It grated to be a VFR-only pilot, but the weather on Friday co-operated beautifully, so I managed to get 4 hours of proper cross-country flight time (3.6 hours air time) on a beautiful spring day.  I was ridiculously nervous beforehand, but on the day of, my flying and radio work through the busy Ottawa and Toronto airspace was fine, and the flight was as boring and uneventful as I want all my flights to be (my rule is that the only excitement in flying should come from the scenery outside the window).  No new milestones from that flight, but I feel confident now to start back into the night and IFR work &mdash; 2 more milestones to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four and a half years ago I complained about a <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2004/11/29/bush-tfr/">Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) for President Bush&#8217;s visit to Ottawa</a>.  I like President Obama a lot better than I liked President Bush &mdash; and I&#8217;m very excited that he&#8217;s making his first foreign visit as president to my city &mdash; but out of fairness, I still have to complain about the TFR.</p>
<p>You see, a TFR isn&#8217;t a very Canadian thing.  It&#8217;s not that we don&#8217;t know what fear and terrorism are &mdash; around 1970, bombs were going off in Montreal, and a provincial cabinet minister was kidnapped and murdered; even more recently, the Iranian embassy here in Ottawa was bombed; <a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/kcic1/cdnwtc.html">24 of the 9/11 victims were Canadian</a>; and the police in Toronto recently arrested a bunch of bozos who were talking big about doing terrorist stuff, though it&#8217;s unlikely they were smart or motivated enough to pull anything off.  It&#8217;s just that, like the British with their IRA crisis, at least some of us have learned that heavy-handed security doesn&#8217;t actually solve problems; instead, it makes people more scared, and when people are scared, the world becomes more dangerous for everyone.</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t shut down hundreds of square miles of airspace for our amusement parks, our Prime Minister, or even our Queen.  In fact, our Prime Minister sometimes walks his kids to school.  Before 9/11, you could essentially fly right past the windows of Parliament; now, you have to fly 1,000 ft AGL over Parliament, or 0.5 nm away, but you can still fly pretty close (and even those restrictions don&#8217;t apply if you&#8217;re landing or taking off IFR under ATC control).</p>
<p>&#8216;Nuff said.  Here&#8217;s the TFR for the president&#8217;s visit next week:</p>
<pre>

DLA MAY BE ANTICIPATED.
0902191500 TIL 0902192300
</pre>
<p>Basically, unless you&#8217;re security, an airline, or medevac, don&#8217;t fly within 30nm of the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYOW/">Ottawa Airport</a> from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm next Thursday below 12,500 ft MSL, period.  That&#8217;s actually harsher than the typical presidential TFR in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> removed Le Bourget.</em></p>
<p>ICAO <strong>Class A</strong> (&#8220;class alfa&#8221;) airspace is the strictest of all, allowing only IFR operations (without special permission).  In the U.S. and southern Canada, most airspace between FL180 and FL600 is class A (the floor is higher as you get further north in Canada).</p>
<p>Even the busiest airports rarely designate their control zones as class A: the U.S., for example, contains 15 of the world&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/top30/">30 busiest airports</a> by passenger traffic, but they are designated only Class B (&#8220;class bravo&#8221;), so routine controlled VFR operations are still permitted (I&#8217;ve flown my warrior into some of them, IFR and VFR).</p>
<p>Around the world, however, there exists a tiny handful of <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/tags/class-a/">Class A airports</a>.  Here are the Class A airports I know about so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/airports/LLBG/">Ben Gurion International Airport</a>, Tel Aviv, Israel</li>
<li><a href="/airports/LFPG/">Charles de Gaulle International Airport</a>, Paris, France</li>
<li><a href="/airports/SKBO/">El Dorado International Airport</a>, Bogatá, Columbia</li>
<li><a href="/airports/LXGB/">Gibraltar Airport</a>, Gibraltar</li>
<li><a href="/airports/EGLL/">Heathrow Airport</a>, London, UK</li>
<li><del><a href="/airports/LFPB/">Le Bourget Airport</a>, Paris, France</del></li>
<li><a href="/airports/LFPO/">Orly Airport</a>, Paris, France</li>
</ul>
<p>There appears to be no single reason for the designation — it&#8217;s certainly not due to traffic alone.  Tel Aviv is probably Class A for security reasons, being so near hostile soil, and Bogatá&#8217;s designation may have something to do with drug smuggling.  Heathrow is busy (though not as busy as some U.S. airports), but it also operates in very confined airspace.  Gibraltar has about three scheduled flights a day — go figure.  (It&#8217;s near the Spanish border, but many major airports operate very close to international borders; many busy airports also operate near high terrain).  <del>Le Bourget has no scheduled flights at all, but</del> Parisians are Parisians, and <em>zut alors!</em> if London has one Class A airport, Paris will show them by having <del>three</del> <ins>two</ins>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KDCA/">Reagan National Airport</a> in Washington DC has additional restrictions that make it similar to Class A, but is still designated Class B.  Does anyone know of any other Class A airports that I&#8217;ve missed?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, a woman went into labour and gave birth on a scheduled airline flight from <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/EHAM/">Amsterdam</a> to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KBOS/">Boston</a> [<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Federal+lawyers+wrestle+over+baby+citizenship/1135941/story.html">story</a>].  At the time of the birth, the airliner was in Canadian airspace.  The flight crew had considered diverting, but the doctors who were assisting (passengers called in to help) said there was no point, because the labour was happening so quickly.  When the flight landed in Boston, U.S. immigration admitted the mother as a Ugandan citizen, but the baby as a Canadian citizen.  Now the Government of Canada has agreed, and granted Baby Sasha Canadian citizenship [<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/story.html?id=1151176">story</a>].</p>
<h3>Canadian soil</h3>
<p>Anyone born on Canadian soil (other than a child of diplomats) is automatically a Canadian citizen, but what about someone born in Canadian airspace?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: there are no customs requirements for entering Canadian or American airspace, when the final destination is not in that country &mdash; the pilot only has to be in contact with an air traffic control unit.  Sometimes the controllers aren&#8217;t even from the same country: Canadian controllers in Toronto, for example, handle some U.S. airspace in Upper Michigan, while American controllers handle some Canadian airspace around Windsor, ON.</p>
<h3>A new business opportunity?</h3>
<p>That means that I could take off from the U.S. in a medevac-equipped Cessna Caravan with a woman about to give birth, get permission from <em>American controllers</em> to enter Canadian airspace, then circle over Windsor until the baby is born.  Voilà!  A new Canadian citizen!</p>
<p>To be honest, that sounds a little far-fetched as an immigration scam or as a grey-marked business model: it would be easier for the pregnant woman just to come into Canada as a tourist and give birth more comfortably on the ground.  Besides, I&#8217;m hugely pro-immigration — I think Canada&#8217;s new immigrant communities are among its greatest strengths, and I welcome Baby Sasha as a fellow citizen.</p>
<h3>Whose laws?</h3>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s an interesting precedent that someone who was never vetted by immigration officials can still be considered to be &#8220;in Canada&#8221;.  My concern is that it might lead to both Canada and the U.S. imposing new restrictions on foreign planes using their airspace.</p>
<p>In 10 years, will Canadian G.A. pilots still be able to take the shortcut across Maine to Nova Scotia, for example, just by making a quick radio call to Boston Center and getting a squawk code, or will we have to file paperwork five days in advance and wait for approval from Washington?  Does that mean that Canadian law now applies to passengers while they&#8217;re in Canadian airspace (not just aviation regulations, but other laws)?  Will Saudi laws about alcohol and women&#8217;s clothing apply to passengers in an airliner while it&#8217;s passing over Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to AOPA, the <a href="http://www.aopa.org/faafundingdebate/">biggest issue facing general aviation</a> in the U.S. is the risk of user fees.  I agree with Phil Boyer that user fees could hurt GA, especially if they are per use (as in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/AU/">Australia) rather than flat fees (as in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/CA/">Canada</a>, with <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2006/04/13/nav-canada-approves-new-service-charges/">one misguided exception</a>); however, I think that there are even bigger issues facing North American general aviation.  Here, on no scientific basis whatsoever, are my top five:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The end of AvGas:</strong> Almost nobody makes AvGas any more, it&#8217;s expensive to transport, and environmentalists rightly hate it because it&#8217;s leaded.  Watch for it to get rarer and more expensive, with more and more shortages, over the next few years, at the same time as ethanol in MoGas renders it unsuitable for the few aircraft engines that could use it.  The solution? Diesel engines, but they&#8217;re still expensive to install (nearly the whole cost of my plane), probably won&#8217;t ever be approved for all existing models, and do not yet have a significant North American maintenance network in place.  Most old planes will have to be retired, and most pilots won&#8217;t be able to afford to replace &#8217;em, so they&#8217;ll retire with their planes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(In)Security:</strong> It&#8217;s there, and it&#8217;s not going to go away.  The general public has always been afraid of airplanes (I&#8217;ve posted in the past about how <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2005/07/11/how-airshows-hurt-aviation/">we exacerbate the problem by promoting air shows</a>), and general aviation in particular scares them because it&#8217;s so lightly regulated.   In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, one of the candidates <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2004/10/04/medicals/">was a GA pilot</a> and went out of his way not to cause problems for his fellow pilots; in 2008, we probably won&#8217;t be that lucky. And the next time something bad happens, watch for GA to be the scapegoat even more than in 2001: we could be regulated right out of existence on either or both sides of the border.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airport closures:</strong> New residential neighbourhoods, either on reclaimed industrial land in the city or former farmland in the country, almost always mean bad news for general aviation.  Airports are useful only when they&#8217;re near somewhere you want to go, so the most useful airports are typically also the most threatened: <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYTZ/">Toronto City Centre Airport</a> is constantly under seige from nearby condo dwellers, for example, and even little <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Rockcliffe Airport</a> struggles with community noise complaints (note that both of these airports have been there since before World War II).  Airports aren&#8217;t the only ones who suffer from the soccer-mom onslaught: in rural areas farmers have to deal with complaints from new subdivisions about noise and smell, hunters have to go further away to hunt, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Most of the GA fleet is, and will remain, old &mdash; very few of us can shell out $300K-$1M for  a new light plane, so we have to settle for spending $20K-$150K on something older.  It would take only a couple of expensive Airworthiness Directives from the FAA or Transport Canada to knock a huge part of the fleet out of the sky by requiring a repair worth more than the planes&#8217; resale value.  Furthermore, the shops that maintain these planes for us often operate on a shoestring, billing much less per hour than an auto shop, and in the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/">U.S.</a> a few of them are starting to <a href="http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2007/070108maintenance.html">refuse to work on older planes</a> for liability reasons (U.S. law protects manufacturers from being sued once the planes are a certain age, so the shop would be the only one to go after in a crash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User fees:</strong> We&#8217;ve been paying these in Canada for a while now, and since they&#8217;ve remained low and fixed (thanks to COPA), they don&#8217;t seem to have had any impact at all on GA.  However, that could change easily.  If either Canada or the U.S. introduced a pay-per-use system, flying could quickly become too expensive and/or too dangerous for most GA owners.  For example, if you had to pay $100 each time you filed IFR, scud running might become a bit more tempting; if you had to pay $25 for a weather briefing, you&#8217;d be less likely to talk to a specialist about icing.  Realistically, I don&#8217;t think this is as big a threat as the others, but I&#8217;m still grateful that COPA and AOPA (I&#8217;m a member of both) are looking out for our interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> The ELT is back and recertified with a new battery, but the forecast tomorrow calls for cloud and ice from about hilltop level to 9,000 ft, so the Hope Air flight is canceled.</em></p>
<p>UNSAR is the Transport Canada acronym for an <cite>UnNecessary Search And Rescue</cite> alert.  In addition to publicising the problem in <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/SystemSafety/Newsletters/tp185/1-03/436.htm">a newsletter article</a>, they have produced a poster that&#8217;s shown in most FBOs and flying clubs with rescue aircraft circling a delivery van, a (perfectly OK) float plane, etc., while in the bottom right panel a real crash goes unattended.</p>
<p>I was on my way home from a family breakfast Sunday morning when I noticed a message on my cell phone.  The SAR centre picked up an ELT signal from the vicinity of Rockcliffe Airport, and after a line check, they determined that it was coming from my plane.  I was out there within 45 minutes, and determined that</p>
<ol>
<li>The signal <em>was</em> coming from my plane (strong enough that it spilled over onto other frequencies).</li>
<li>The cockpit ELT switch was set to &#8220;arm&#8221;, not &#8220;on&#8221;.</li>
<li>Turning the switch to &#8220;off&#8221; stopped the ELT for a minute or so, then it started again.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would have been better, of course, if I&#8217;d been in the habit of turning the cockpit switch to &#8220;off&#8221; whenever I parked the plane, but in this case, it wouldn&#8217;t have helped &#8212; after a couple of weeks of constant rain, my guess is that some moisture got into the side panels and shorted the switch, since the ELT was intermittently activating with the switch in any position.  With freezing, fumbling fingers, I grabbed a Phillips screwdriver (<em>always</em> keep a multi-head screwdriver in your plane), opened the access panel in the tailcone, shoved my hands through the tiny, sharp-edged access hole (we don&#8217;t pay mechanics enough), turned the main switch on the ELT unit from &#8220;arm&#8221; to &#8220;off&#8221;, disconnected the antenna and wires, and figured out how to remove the unit.</p>
<p>Just as I was finishing, a SAR person walked up to the airplane to talk to me. He was very friendly and reassuring about the whole thing as he copied down the details from my ELT box (recertified May 2006) and confirmed the time that I shut down the unit, so that the SAR centre could close the file on the activation.  I also learned a couple of interesting tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of an UNSAR, standard procedure (if the owner or pilot couldn&#8217;t be located fast) used to be to get access to the plane as fast as possible causing as little damage as possible, but after complaints, SOP is now simply to wait for the battery to die.</li>
<li>Further to the first point, the equipment used by the SAR satellite monitoring centre is now good enough to distinguish the idiosyncracies of the crystal used in each specific radio, so that one ELT signal won&#8217;t prevent them from distinguishing another one (though it must make it no fun for airliners, and FSS and ATC units that have to monitor 121.5 continuously).</li>
</ul>
<p>It also turns out that this weekend there was a survival training camp at Rockcliffe hosted by the SAR people, so my UNSAR gave them a chance to practice homing in on a real ELT signal on 121.5 (usually they have to use separate training frequencies).  While I&#8217;m very sorry for all the hassle caused to so many people, I&#8217;m glad that some tiny good came out of it.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m taking my ELT unit into the avionics shop to have it reinspected (I expect that it&#8217;s fine) and to have the battery tested, since I don&#8217;t know how much it drained during the activation.  After that, I&#8217;ll reinstall it in the plane, but won&#8217;t reconnect the cockpit switch until I can have it inspected as well (I&#8217;ll placard that the script is U/S and will write a snag in my Journey Log to cover the legal bases).  I&#8217;m also going to remove the pilot-side panels to see if there is water getting in there somehow.</p>
<p>I could legally fly the plane for 30 days without an ELT as long as I put a placard in the panel, but I have a Hope Air flight coming up across hundreds of miles of nothing (the kind of area where every building is shown on the map, and there&#8217;s enough room for a small U.S. state in-between them).  The ELT activation was an accident, but flying across wilderness in winter weather with no ELT would be just stupid.</p>
<p>So, for those of you considering becoming aircraft owners, are you still interested?  Even with a simple plane like a Cherokee or 172, you can expect 2-to-5 unexpected minor crises like this every year, though most don&#8217;t involve anyone but you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img align="right" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2e/Cessna208BGrandCaravan01.jpg" /><br />
Because of the accident record, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sent <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/2006/A06_01_03.pdf">a letter to the FAA</a> suggesting a temporary restriction on Cessna&#8217;s single-engine turboprop, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_208">Cessna 208 Caravan</a>, from flying into any known icing conditions worse than light icing. Now, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has issued <a href="http://www.tsb.gc.ca/en/media/communiques/air/2006/comm_a05c0187.asp">a communiqué</a> making the same suggestion (via <a href="http://www.aviation.ca/">aviation.ca</a>). So far, the FAA, who has the final say for the American-certified plane, has not agreed.</p>
<p>The FAA is in a tight bind here.  Many small freight and charter operations that used to fly twins (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-31_Navaho">Piper Navajo</a>) switched to the single-engine Caravan to save money because, like the piston twins, the Caravan is certified for flight into known icing conditions. Some of these operations might not be financially viable if they have to go back to the higher cost of twins, and all of them will be forced to sell Caravans at the same time into what will be a very depressed market.</p>
<p>The immediate impetus for this double pressure on the FAA is the fatal crash of a Caravan in Winnipeg in October 2005. John, a Caravan pilot himself, blogs about that crash <a href="http://freightdogtales.blogspot.com/2005/10/deadly-descent.html">here</a>. For more information from the perspective of a freight dog flying a Caravan in icing conditions, read John&#8217;s other postings over at <a href="http://freightdogtales.blogspot.com/">Freight Dog Tales</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was discussing <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2005/11/29/a-low-approach-and-the-lights/">this approach</a> with some U.S. pilots before I revised the numbers up &#8212; at the time, I remembered not seeing the runway until below 100 feet, though now I&#8217;m fairly certain I saw it at 130 feet.</p>
<p>I was taken aback when one of the U.S. pilots asked me if this was a confession.  It turns out that the U.S. regulations for descending below DH or MDA are different from the Canadian regulations &#8212; in Canada, once we&#8217;ve seen the <em>required visual reference</em> (such as approach lights, or the PAPI), we&#8217;re OK to land &#8212; legally, if not safely &#8212; even if we don&#8217;t actually see the runway until the wheels touch it.  See <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/publications/tp14371/RAC/9-1.htm#9-19-3">RAC 9.19.3 <cite>Landing Minima</cite></a> in the Canadian AIM for details.</p>
<p>The American regulations in <a href="http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgFAR.nsf/0/66AFE97435E47B3A86256E1A00518D27?OpenDocument">FAR 91.175</a> have similar required visual references, but there is an important addition of a step-down altitude when you spot the approach lights first:</p>
<blockquote><p>
(3) Except for a Category II or Category III approach where any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:<br />
(i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.<br />
[&#8230;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>That extra 100 foot restriction isn&#8217;t in the Canadian regulations.  In fact, AN (SSALR) approach lighting doesn&#8217;t even have red side row bars, and the terminating bar is green.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Update: after a night&#8217;s rest, I&#8217;ve gone back to the approach plate to get the threshold elevation, and have tried to remember the exact reports I gave North Bay radio; as a result, I&#8217;ve revised all altitudes up a little.]</p>
<p>On her blog, Aviatrix has been running an interesting series on Canadian runway and approach lighting systems (here&#8217;s the <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2005/11/arcal-and-as.html">first article</a>).  Approach lights figured big in my own flying today &#8212; after a long and difficult IMC flight, I had planned to take the LOC (BC)/DME 26 approach into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bay/Jack_Garland_Airport">North Bay Airport</a>, since the ATIS was reporting a ceiling of about 1,000 feet.  Toronto Centre talked to North Bay Radio and decided to vector me the long way around for the ILS 08 instead, because of fog near the end of 26.  Then a PIREP (pilot report) came in reporting a 100 foot ceiling.</p>
<p>It took a long time to circle around over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nipissing">Lake Nippising</a> and join the ILS &#8212; I had glimpses of the city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bay%2C_Ontario">North Bay</a> below me, but no airport ahead.  At <s>400</s> <u>500</u> ft AGL and almost at the field, I still saw nothing.  At <s>250 or 350 feet AGL (I no longer remember)</s> <u>430 feet AGL</u>, I saw the approach lights cutting clearly through the fog, but no ground or runway.  I knew that <em>in theory</em> it was legal to land seeing only a few approach lights, but it sounded terrifying, and I never imagined I&#8217;d try; however, it was actually a fairly simple thing to do, no harder than setting up for a runway, and certainly not stressful, at least not in a slow plane like a Warrior.  I lined up with the lights (I&#8217;ll admit that they didn&#8217;t appear <em>straight</em> ahead of me, since I was drifting and bouncing a lot in the turbulence) and planned to touch down just a bit past them.  Somewhere around <s>50-100 feet</s> <u>130 feet AGL</u>, just before I crossed the threshold, the runway suddenly popped in below me, and I made a normal (if slightly long) landing.</p>
<p>Aviatrix: they were AN &#8212; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve covered that yet.  It&#8217;s amazing how they can punch through the fog and let you make a legal (and fairly safe) landing when the ceiling is <s>under</s> <u>just over</u> 100 feet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most Canadian pilots, I&#8217;m running pretty late updating my <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/regserv/Affairs/AIP/menu.htm">AIP</a>, so I just noticed the contents of Aeronautical Information Circular 10/05 from last April.  It&#8217;s worth quoting in full:</p>
<hr />
<h2>Removal of the phrase &#8220;VFR flight not recommended&#8221; in pilot briefing</h2>
<p>Until now, a flight service specialist was required to state the phrase &#8220;VFR FLIGHT NOT RECOMMENDED&#8221; at the beginning of a pilot briefing for a VFR flight when extensive instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) or conditions that may affect the safety of the flight were reported or forecast to occur along the planned route of flight.  The phrase was advisory in nature and the conditions that prompted the use of the phrase were then to be stated and the pilot was to be asked if a briefing was still required.</p>
<p>Pilots have requested that the phrase no longer [be] used in briefings.  It was reported that flights were cancelled because the phrase was used even though the flights could have been conducted.</p>
<p>NAV CANADA recognizes that the responsibility for determining if a flight should be conducted or not rests solely with the pilot.  The requirement for flight service specialists to use the phrase &#8220;VFR FLIGHT NOT RECOMMENDED&#8221; is discontinued and the phrase will no longer be used at the beginning of a pilot briefing.  Significant meteorological information that could influence the pilot to alter or cancel the proposed flight will continue to be provided at the beginning of the briefing in accordance with current practice.</p>
<p>Kathleen Fox, Vice-President, Operations</p>
<hr />
<p>Most U.S. pilots I&#8217;ve talked to hate the phrase &#8220;VFR not recommended&#8221;, but I don&#8217;t remember ever having heard it in Canada, even before this circular went around.  This is similar to the attitude towards icing &#8212; Canadian forecasts mention icing only when there is a strong possibility of moderate-to-severe, while the U.S. puts out a standard icing NOTAM if there is even a small chance of trace-to-light.  I&#8217;m not sure which side is safer to err on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aviatrix&#8217;s recent (and informative) post about <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2005/08/legal-alternate-part-one.html">alternate minima</a> raises an interesting question: <em>what&#8217;s a runway?</em>  For example, let&#8217;s take a medium-sized airport with a single paved surface, designated 09/27.</p>
<p>Most of us, describing the airport to a friend in the pilot&#8217;s lounge, would say that the airport has a single runway 09/27.  However, the CAP would publish approach approaches to two different runways, 09 and 27, and the control tower might say &#8220;we&#8217;re switching the active runway from 09 to 27&#8221;.  Both runway 09 and 27 will have the same surface type, snow removal, and edge lighting, but they might have different landing and takeoff distances (due to displaced thresholds) and different approach lighting, and most importantly, they&#8217;ll be used under different wind conditions.  In the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere, where I live, the wind will generally be from the west in good weather, so runway 27 would be used most often; however, the wind will often be from the east during times of low visibility, so runway 09 is more likely to see instrument approaches in low IMC.</p>
<p>All of this has to do with the Canadian alternate minima Aviatrix mentions in her posting.  According to the CAP GEN, you can choose an alternate with forecast 400-1 weather only if there are &#8220;two or more usable precision approaches each providing straight-in minima to separate suitable runways.&#8221;  So if my hypothetical airport had both an ILS 09 and an ILS 27 approach, and the airport were reporting 400 ft ceiling, 1 statute mile visibility, and winds from 180 at 2 knots, would it be a legal alternate?  (I grant in advance that flying when your best available alternate is forecast to be 400-1 is pretty questionable regardless) .</p>
<p>Even if 09 and 27 count as two runways, requiring at least two usable straight-in precision approaches gives some insurance: if the wind shifts suddenly to 270@15 knots (but the visibility stays strangely poor), you can still fly the ILS 09.  If a small fog bank drifts over the threshold of 09, you can still fly the ILS 27.  On the other hand, requiring precision approaches to two separate runway <em>surfaces</em> gives a bit of extra insurance.  If someone does a wheels-up landing and closes down 09/27, for example, you can still land on 18/36 (unless, of course, the wheels-up plane came to rest right at the runway intersection).</p>
<p>Because of this second point, it seems that many instructors and examiners have passed on by word of mouth that <em>separate suitable runways</em> means <em>separate suitable runway surfaces</em> &#8212; i.e. runway 09/27 and runway 18/36, not runway 09 and runway 27.  However, I have not yet succeeded in finding any formal definition, and the AIP and other Canadian publications (not to mention pilots) use the word <em>runway</em> both ways.  In real life, this situation is extremely improbable &#8212; very few Canadian airports have ILS approaches from both directions to a single runway surface, and those that do are big airports like Toronto/Pearson and Montreal/Trudeau with lots of other precision approaches available.</p>
<p>Still, what&#8217;s a runway?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weather at the airport is reported below minima &#8212; is it legal to try the approach anyway, just to take a look, before heading to your alternate?  This is one area where the rules in Canada and the U.S. seem to differ quite a bit.</p>
<p>In the U.S., aircraft operating under <a href="http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/CurrentFARPart!OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=200&amp;Expand=22#22">FAR Part 91</a> (private and some commercial operations) have no restriction at all: they are free to try an approach even if the weather is reported as 0 ceiling and visibility.  U.S. aircraft operating under <a href="http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/CurrentFARPart!OpenView&amp;Start=1&amp;Count=200&amp;Expand=32#32">FAR Part 135</a> (charter and commuter, sort-of) are not allowed even to attempt an approach unless the weather is at or above minima.  This is probably a gross oversimplification, but it gets the rough idea across.</p>
<p>Canada falls somewhere in between these two extremes.  We have something called the <cite>Approach Ban</cite>, laying in out gory detail when the pilot of any flight (private or commercial) is allow to attempt an approach based on <cite>Runway Visual Range</cite> (RVR) reports from transmissometers located at the runway threshold (RVR &#8220;A&#8221;) and mid-runway (RVR &#8220;B&#8221;):</p>
<ul>
<li>When only RVR &#8220;A&#8221; or RVR &#8220;B&#8221; is available for the approach runway, it must be reporting at least 1,200 ft.</li>
<li>When RVR &#8220;A&#8221; and RVR &#8220;B&#8221; are available for the approach runway, RVR &#8220;A&#8221; must be reporting at least 1,200 ft, and RVR &#8220;B&#8221; must be reporting at least 600 feet for fix-wing aircraft (any value is OK for rotorcraft).</li>
</ul>
<p>If these conditions are not met, then an aircraft is not allowed to complete an approach past the outer marker or final approach fix.  There are a whole bunch of exceptions, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the aircraft is already inside the OM or FAF inbound when it receives the report, it may continue;</li>
<li>if the aircraft has informed ATC that it is on a training flight and plans to go missed, it may continue;</li>
<li>if the RVR is fluctuating above and below, and the reported airport visibility is at least 1/4 SM, the aircraft may continue; and</li>
<li>if the aircraft is conducting a CAT III approach, it may continue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even more importantly, the ban applies only to airports operating transmissometers on the approach runway &#8212; if you&#8217;re flying into a medium or small airport, or even approaching a smaller runway at a big airport, there are usually no transmissometers, and therefore, no approach ban.</p>
<p>That said, as far as I understand (never having sat through commercial ground school), commercial operations all have Transport-Canada-approved operating manuals that can place additional restrictions on what pilots flying for the operator are allowed to do, and these may go far beyond the approach ban (especially since they&#8217;re usually ammended after every an accident or incident).</p>
<p>Corrections and elaborations are welcome in the comments, especially from pilots who <em>have</em> sat through commercial groundschool on either side of the border.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doug Robertson in Calgary is about to start training for his instrument rating, and has <a href="http://blogs.zymeta.com/roller/page/dr/20050705#starting_ifr">mentioned</a> that there are few online resources specifically about IFR training in Canada.  Obviously, though, there are a lot of American resources.  Here are some of the differences between Canadian and U.S. IFR training, based on my own experience in Canada and many conversations with U.S. pilots:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Partial-panel work is heavily emphasized in the U.S., and forms part of the IFR checkride, where there is often (always?) a partial-panel approach as part of the test.  In Canada, you might do a bit of partial-panel work on the sim or in your plane, but it is not automatically part of the flight test (though the examiner can simulate some kind of a failure), and you are very unlikely to be asked to do a partial-panel approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery from an unusual attitude under the hood is part of the U.S. IFR flight test, but not part of the test in Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the U.S., NDB training is something that usually happens during IFR training and is then abandoned; in Canada, NDB is still a practical, day-to-day part of life, especially if you have to fly up north, so people seem to get less stressed about it, and thus, have a lot fewer problems with it (an NDB hold can actually be easier than a VOR hold).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Canadian IFR flight test is almost unbelievably short.  The in-air portion involves mainly tracking a radial from a navaid, performing one hold, and flying two approaches, one of which must be a precision approach for your first test (the second one is usually your return home).  Other stuff, like showing an ability to accept clearances and talk to ATC, happens automatically during the test. You might spend more time checking your radios and taxiing than you will actually flying.  There&#8217;s also an oral portion before the flight, as in the U.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, you have to retake the IFR flight test every two years, while the U.S. test is valid for life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve passed, note also that the 6/6 rule (six approaches in the last six months to stay current) becomes in Canada the 6/6/6 rule (six approachs <em>and</em> six hours real or simulated IMC in the last six months).  However, your flight test makes you current for a year, so you&#8217;ll have to worry about the 6/6/6 only every second year.</p>
<p>One other nice point about the Canadian test is that, since there&#8217;s no requirement for partial panel or unusual-attitude recovery, you can take the test in actual IMC.  I managed to schedule my first test two years ago for a nice, foggy morning with 400 foot ceilings and silky-smooth air, and I ended up not having to wear the foggles (which I hate almost as much as the hood).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week I decided to go for a short round-robin IFR flight between Ottawa and Pembroke.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I decided to go for a short round-robin IFR flight between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier_International_Airport">Ottawa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Airport">Pembroke</a>.  While I was still in cloud and on the airway, cruising at 6,000 ft, Montreal Centre gave me missed approach instructions and then said</p>
<blockquote><p>
Bravo Juliet Oscar, cleared for an approach to the Pembroke Airport.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That kind of a clearance can sometimes be disconcerting for people (like me) who are used to doing vectored approaches to busy airports with every turn and altitude change micromanaged by ATC.  There&#8217;s a whole lot that Centre expected me to remember to do after giving me the clearance:</p>
<ol>
<li>read back the full approach clearance, for the tapes</li>
<li>select an approach (in this case, there was only one)</li>
<li>turn off the airway and self-navigate towards the initial approach fix (IAF), which, in this case, was an NDB 21 nautical miles away</li>
<li>begin descending from cruise altitude to minimum safe altitude (MSA)</li>
<li>fly the approach and missed</li>
</ol>
<p>The fourth one might trip up American pilots, especially if they get the clearance a long way from the airport.  In Canada, clearance for an approach <em>automatically</em> includes clearance to descend to the minimum charted IFR altitude, which is most typically the 25 nautical mile MSA around the initial approach fix (but may procedure turn altitude on a vectored approach, or a published transition altitude, or even 100 nautical mile safe altitude if you get the clearance a long way back).  In the U.S., the MSA is for emergency use, and clearance for an approach does <em>not</em> include clearance to descend before established on the approach, as far as I understand.</p>
<p>In other words, in Canada, MSA is an operational altitude, like the procedure turn altitude, a step-down altitude, the minimum descent altitude (MDA) or the decision height (DH); in the U.S., it&#8217;s just a safety advisory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time, it was a Canadian plane&#8217;s turn to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/05/24/plane0524.html">violate the DC ADIZ</a>, the enormous restricted airspace around Washington, DC (the plane did not go anywhere near the White House or Capitol).  In fact, planes violate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Defense_Identification_Zone">ADIZ</a> all the time, usually without news coverage.</p>
<p>I wonder if all of this hassle for pilots, air traffic control, the military, and ordinary U.S. citizens brings any public safety benefits.  It&#8217;s telling that New York City, which suffered more than Washington in the September 11 attacks, has almost completely reopened its airspace and does not require any special codes or preclearance (you can fly VFR right into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teterboro_Airport">Teterboro</a>, for example, without filing a flight plan or talking to any ATC unit but Teterboro tower).  Private planes are even allowed back into the <a href="http://articles.worcesterapa.org/Articles/05/04/18/0239235.shtml">Hudson River VFR corridor</a>, where they can fly  at 500 feet MSL between Manhattan and New Jersey, looking into the windows of skyscrapers moving past the wing.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, our nation&#8217;s capital, we briefly had a no-fly zone over most of the city core (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Hill">Parliament Hill</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rideau_Hall">Rideau Hall</a>) up to 3,000 ft MSL after the September 11 attacks, but that has been scaled back so far now that you&#8217;d actually have to be buzzing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Tower">Peace Tower</a> to get busted.  The <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2004/11/29/bush-tfr/">airspace restrictions</a> during President Bush&#8217;s visit last fall gave us a brief taste of what life must be like for pilots in some parts of the U.S., and I can confirm that the flavour was pretty bitter.</p>

<p>In his <a href="http://avcan.blogspot.com/2005/05/may.html">most recent posting</a>, Moncton Centre controller Michael Oxner makes some friendly but justifiable complaints about summer recreational pilots who don&#8217;t bring paper charts in the plane and tie up ATC time when their handheld GPS&#8217;s fail (for those pilots&#8217; sake, I hope that their GPS&#8217;s had terrain information when they <em>were</em> working &#8212; there are mountains pushing above 5,000 ft MSL in Maine on the way from central Canada to the Maritimes).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a trick I thought of after arriving at the airport once for a long (VFR) family trip, loading up the plane, then realizing that I had left my charts at home: I always, <em>always</em>, carry a couple of 1:1,000,000 scale World Aeronautical Charts (WACs) in my flight bag.  WACs have lousy detail but very wide coverage &#8212; just two Canadian WACs (F-21 and F-22) cover nearly any single-day trip I&#8217;d fly inside Canadian airspace, and add no appreciable bulk or weight.  The problem with Canadian WACs, though, is that they&#8217;re not updated very often &#8212; they may be legal, but most of them haven&#8217;t been amended for 10 years or more, so their airspace information is of historical interest only.  For that reason, I actually carry <em>American</em> WACs (CF-18 and CF-19), which are updated regularly and happen to include a lot of Canadian airspace.</p>
<p>Since I own my own plane, I also keep a bunch of charts and approach plates for Ontario and Quebec in a small bag under the pilot&#8217;s seat &#8212; the WACs are actually the backup to my backup now &#8212; but for a renter, a couple of WACs in the flight bag seems like a no-brainer, though 1:500,000 scale VNCs/Sectionals and 1:250,000 scale terminal-area charts are, obviously, preferable.</p>
<p>For anyone with time to kill, a high-speed Internet connection, and no concept of the cost of inkjet toner, you can download the U.S. sectional charts <a href="http://aviationtoolbox.org/raw_data/FAA/sectionals/">here</a> and print them out on your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Updated] The Canadian Press has an <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/cpress/20050416/ca_pr_on_na/float_plane_drownings">unusually detailed and accurate</a> story about floatplane safety in Canada.  Unfortunately, with the summer season arriving, we&#8217;re going to see another big spike in the fatal accident rate in Canada as the floatplanes take to the skies, simply because they normally fly without the safety net we have at certified airports: clear, monitored approach paths, known surfaces, etc. (of course, that&#8217;s the whole point of recreational floatplane flying, to taxi up to your buddy&#8217;s dock at some little lake in cottage country).  Also, the consequences of a hard landing are worse: instead of an embarrasing bounce on a runway, you end up digging in a float and flipping, then trying to escape from a cabin upside-down and underwater with a door latch that won&#8217;t open.</p>
<p>The strangest part of the article is a claim from Transport Canada that &#8212; despite repeated pleas from the Transportation Safety Board, who investigates these fatal accidents &#8212; TC cannot issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) to make floatplane doors easier to open for escaping, because most of the planes are not made in Canada, and thus, are outside their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Perhaps they&#8217;ve forgotten about <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/aviation/applications/cawis-swimn/awd-display-cs2101-wnd.asp?rand=&amp;vMode=0&amp;ovid=CF_CF-90-03_2">AD CF-90-03R2</a>, by which Transport Canada mandates an annual inspection of the muffler shroud for possible carbon-monoxide leaks from my American-certified and built Lycoming engine through the heater into the cabin of my American-certified and built Piper Warrior II (for the record, since I <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2004/10/25/winterization/">fly a lot in the winter</a>, I&#8217;d have this inspection done with or without an AD).</p>
<p>Floatplane flying matters more in Canada than the U.S., so if there&#8217;s going to be an AD, it will have to come from us: while taxiing up to your friend&#8217;s dock is nice, commercial floatplanes are also the lifeline to many small northern communities, bringing in food, medicine, doctors, teachers, etc. and flying out people suffering from medical emergencies.  Even if the floatplane drowning fatalities don&#8217;t add up to a lot in the bigger scheme of things, they leave this small part of the population &#8212; the ones who have no choice but to use floatplanes &#8212; extremely vulnerable.</p>
<p>[Update: the difference between the TSB&#8217;s request and AD CF-90-03 is that the latter deals only with an inspection, while the TSB&#8217;s request deals with a modification &#8212; perhaps that&#8217;s the place where TC is stuck.]</p>

<p>Mike Busch has written a <a href="http://www.avweb.com/news/columns/189306-1.html">column about annual inspections in the U.S.</a>, especially about understandings and misunderstandings among U.S. IA&#8217;s (<em>inspection authorities</em>I think) &#8212; many US IAs think that they are a kind of police force responsible for keeping unsafe planes on the ground, and many US owners think that IAs can hold their planes hostage by squawking them.</p>
<p>In the U.S., after an annual inspection, the IA signs off that the plane is airworthy (or gives a discrepancy list to the owner). In Canada, as far as I understand the regs (and as my AME has explained them to me), the AME does not even have to write that the plane passed or didn&#8217;t pass an annual inspection, at least not for small, private, piston-powered aircraft. Here&#8217;s the exact language from <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/Regserv/Affairs/cars/Part6/Standards/a625b.htm">CARS Standard 625, Appendix B &#8212; Maintenance Schedule</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>(6) Pursuant to CAR 605.86(2), the schedule is considered to be approved for use by owners of small non-commercial operation aircraft and all balloons. Owners need only to make an entry in the aircraft technical records that the aircraft is maintained pursuant to the maintenance schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, I could grab the maintenance schedule, research the ADs, make a list of tasks (inspections and repairs), and take the plane to three different shops, each of which does a third of the work. I would not have to tell any of those shops that the work was part of an annual inspection &#8212; each one would simply write what it did into the logbook. Once I was satisfied that everything required for the annual inspection was finished, I would simply return the aircraft to service, and my annual inspection is finished.</p>
<p>In practice, of course, I wouldn&#8217;t do things that way. I value my the experience and knowledge of my AME, and I want him to take an active role in keeping the plane safe. And, of course, with or without an IA&#8217;s signature, the final responsibility for airworthiness will always lie with the pilot in command.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img align="right" src="https://i0.wp.com/megginson.com/blogs/lahso/images/vfrovercast.jpg" alt="Stuck on top VFR." /></p>
<p>When weather permits, VFR is often a good choice: it gives you more control over your route and altitude than you would have IFR, generally speeds up the trip (since you don&#8217;t have to be spaced and sequenced as much during departure and arrival, especially at busy airports), makes it easier to avoid icing in winter time, and just all-round feels nice.  When there are clouds somewhere along the route, however, you have to make an important decision: VFR underneath, or VFR over the top?</p>
<p>The decision is hardest when the clouds are right around the best cruise altitudes for your plane, say, 3,000 to 8,000 feet for a normally-aspirated piston aircraft like my Warrior.  If you fly underneath, you could end up dealing with precipitation, marginal visibility, hills and towers, and (of course) lots of turbulence; if you fly over the top, you could end up dealing with strong headwinds, and, most importantly, you could get stuck up above an overcast.  For my return to Ottawa from Teterboro, mindful of the Catskill and Adirondack mountains along my route, I chose to go on top at 9,500 feet for the smooth air and lack of mountains to fly into; and yes, I got stuck.</p>
<p>I knew that things weren&#8217;t going my way when the broken cloud layer closed up to an overcast near Saranac Lake, NY instead of breaking up to scattered.  I checked the Massena, NY ASOS (I had planned to descend there, over the flat land) and it was also calling overcast; the Ottawa ATIS, which was coming in from 100 miles away at that altitude, was calling broken clouds. Halfway between Saranac Lake and Massena, I was handed off to Montreal Centre for flight following, and I talked to them about the situation, warning that I might need an IFR clearance to get down.  The controller insisted that the latest weather for Massena was showing scattered (as I&#8217;m sure it was, as far as the data available to the controller went), so I said that I could wait until closer to Ottawa.</p>
<p>In the end, I got my clearance for an IFR descent inside Ottawa Terminal airspace.  I knew that the cloud layer was too thin to hold any large, supercooled water droplets, so icing wouldn&#8217;t be a major issue; still, I activated all of the meagre ice-prevention gear at the Warrior&#8217;s disposal before starting down: pitot-static heat on, carb heat full, heat on defrost.  The clouds were less than 1,000 feet of stratocumulus, and I was through them and back VFR in a couple of minutes, as expected.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s try some <em>what if</em>s.  What if I hadn&#8217;t been flying an IFR-capable aircraft, or weren&#8217;t IFR current?  There was no hole that a VFR pilot could have used &#8212; the biggest one I saw near Ottawa was about 50 meters long, and mostly there were no holes at all.  Canadian VFR pilots require a special rating and 15 hours instrument time to fly VFR over the top, but US pilots have no such requirement.  If I had been a new American PPL, with (say) 70 hours experience, arriving at Ottawa stuck on top of the overcast with only my required 30 minutes VFR fuel reserve, how would ATC have dealt with me?  Obviously, Montreal didn&#8217;t have up-to-date information about Massena &#8212; might they have sent me somewhere similar, where I might have found nothing but more overcast?  The centre controller could tell that I wasn&#8217;t in trouble by my calm tone of voice and the specificity of my request (&#8220;I might need an IFR clearance to get down&#8221; rather than &#8220;I need to find some way to get down&#8221; or even &#8220;oh my god! oh my god!&#8221;), so I was handled much more casually than my hypothetical VFR-only pilot.  I&#8217;d like to know how they would have handled that pilot, who might have been getting more and more panicky as the fuel got lower and the cloud layer stayed solid underneath.</p>
<p>My flight met all the requirements for VFR over top &#8212; the sky was clear at my point of departure, Massena was forecast scattered, giving me a way down, etc. &#8212; but I still got stuck.  Does VFR over the top make sense for non-instrument rated pilots?  Certainly, it&#8217;s safer than scud running around mountains, but I would not have wanted to be up there without the IFR option.  At least a much bigger required fuel reserve would be a good idea.</p>
