										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, when I was flying back from <a href="http://ourairports.com/airports/CYFC/">Fredericton</a> to <a href="http://ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Ottawa</a>, I picked up a splash of clear ice in a cloud top over Maine.</p>
<p>I use my <i>Outside Air Temperature</i> (OAT) probe as an early ice detector, since thinner surfaces collect ice before fatter ones (like a wing). Here&#8217;s what I saw:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_142208.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-966" src="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_142208.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_20151002_142208" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I immediately climbed higher, even though the air was colder (-12&deg;c), because I knew that the sunlight would cause the ice to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)">sublimate</a>, passing straight from frozen to vapour without ever thawing.  These pictures show what happened over the next half hour:</p>
<p><a href="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_142208.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-966" src="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_142208.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_20151002_142208" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_145309.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-967" src="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_145309.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_20151002_145309" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_150433.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-968" src="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_150433.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_20151002_150433" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_152019.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-969" src="https://quoderatech.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151002_152019.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="IMG_20151002_152019" width="223" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Sublimation is much slower than thawing, so if you have the choice to descend into warmer air, do it.  When there&#8217;s just a trace, though, and you can get safely above the clouds, sublimation isn&#8217;t a bad option.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re going on a 300 nm (550 km) flight — a typical distance for a cross-country trip in a small plane — VFR, without radar coverage. &nbsp;You file a flight plan, take off on time, but don&#8217;t arrive at your destination. &nbsp;A couple of hours after your planned arrival time, once flight services has completed a few phone calls (your destination airport, your cell phone, your emergency contact) and confirmed that you haven&#8217;t landed safely and forgotten to close your flight plan, a formal search begins.</p>
<p>Where do they look?</p>
<h3>Point A to Point B</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that you filed your flight plan from Point A to Point B and that there are no obvious barriers (mountains, large bodies of water, restricted airspace). &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure exactly how SAR works, but let&#8217;s assume that they&#8217;ll search within a 5 nm radius of each airport, and along your route of flight from those circles, allowing for a 10° drift in either direction. &nbsp;The search area appears in grey below (not to scale):</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_383" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-383" loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="383" data-permalink="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/14/why-checkpoints-matter/search-and-rescue/" data-orig-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png" data-orig-size="682,263" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="search-and-rescue" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=640" class="size-full wp-image-383" title="search-and-rescue" src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=640&#038;h=246" alt="" width="640" height="246" srcset="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=638&amp;h=246 638w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=150&amp;h=58 150w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png?w=300&amp;h=116 300w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue.png 682w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-383" class="wp-caption-text">Point A to Point B search area.</p></div>
<p>For a 300 nm flight, using my very rusty high school geometry skills, I calculate the search area to be nearly 9,500 nm²! &nbsp;That&#8217;s a lot of forest to search for a little plane with an unconscious pilot strapped into the front seat.</p>
<h3>Point A to Point B (via Point C)</h3>
<p>Fortunately, we can improve our chances quite a bit, simply by providing a checkpoint halfway through the flight:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_384" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-384" loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="384" data-permalink="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/14/why-checkpoints-matter/search-and-rescue-2/" data-orig-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png" data-orig-size="682,263" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="search-and-rescue-2" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Point A to Point B via Point C, a checkpoint halfway through the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=640" class="size-full wp-image-384" title="search-and-rescue-2" src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=640&#038;h=246" alt="" width="640" height="246" srcset="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=638&amp;h=246 638w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=150&amp;h=58 150w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png?w=300&amp;h=116 300w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-2.png 682w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-384" class="wp-caption-text">Point A to Point B via Point C search area.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now that Search and Rescue knows that you intended to fly via Point C (represented by the yellow triangle), rather than, say, flying to the north for better scenery, or to the south to buzz your buddy&#8217;s cottage, they can anchor their drift lines at an additional point, cutting out a lot of search area (I&#8217;m still allowing a 5 nm circle of ambiguity around the checkpoint). &nbsp;I calculate that the search area is now reduced from nearly 9,500 nm² to just under 5,500 nm², a reduction of over 40% simply by adding one checkpoint in the flight plan.</p>
<h3>Point C to Point B</h3>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! &nbsp;Let&#8217;s say that, when you were over Point C (your midway checkpoint), you actually made a call to flight services and gave a position report. &nbsp;Now there&#8217;s no need to search anything before Point C, because they know you passed it before you made your forced landing:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_387" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-387" loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="387" data-permalink="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/14/why-checkpoints-matter/search-and-rescue-3/" data-orig-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png" data-orig-size="682,263" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="search-and-rescue-3" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Point C to Point B search area, after having made a radio call over Point C.&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=640" class="size-full wp-image-387" title="search-and-rescue-3" src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=640&#038;h=246" alt="" width="640" height="246" srcset="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=638&amp;h=246 638w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=150&amp;h=58 150w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png?w=300&amp;h=116 300w, https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/search-and-rescue-3.png 682w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-387" class="wp-caption-text">Search area after making a radio call over Point C.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">You&#8217;ve reduced the search area from the original 9,500 nm² down to about 2,800 nm² — still a lot, but I&#8217;d bet more on your chances now. &nbsp;Simply choosing a checkpoint, and making a radio call over it, can make a huge difference.</p>
<h3>Caveats, etc.</h3>
<p><strong>Flight following</strong> is an even better option, since ATC will know much more precisely where you disappeared from the radar. &nbsp;Unfortunately, flight following at lower altitudes is available only in highly populated areas. &nbsp;In Canada, &nbsp;below 10,000 ft you&#8217;re beyond radar coverage for much of the southern area of the country, not to mention the vast north. &nbsp;Even in the US, radar coverage can be spotty — I&#8217;ve fallen below radar at 7,000 ft when flying IFR in both Maine and New Hampshire, for example, reverting to non-radar reporting procedures.</p>
<p>A checkpoint makes sense only if you can report over it, which means that you need to be able to <strong>reach flight services</strong>, which is non-trivial at low altitudes away from populated areas. &nbsp;I plan my VFR flights with checkpoints that I know will be in range of an RCO or DRCO; if that doesn&#8217;t work, you can always try relaying your position report through another aircraft (air-to-air range is much further than air-to-ground).</p>
<p>Another interesting option for people who fly a lot in remote areas is the <strong>Spot personal messenger</strong> (<a href="http://www.findmespot.ca/en/">site</a>), which updates your position continuously via GPS and satellite and displays it on a web site.  I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but the price looks reasonable.  It would be critical to mention the Spot in the remarks for your VFR flight plan, so that SAR would know to go to the site and check your flight path.</p>

<p>Last week I wrote about <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/07/the-summer-flying-dilemma/">the summer flying dilemma</a>, the challenge of balancing passenger comfort, speed, and the rising summer cumulus clouds.  Pilots face a whole series of dilemmas like that with every flight — in fact, it&#8217;s probably fair to say that flying is more about finding balanced solutions to different dilemmas than it is managing the yoke, rudder, and throttle.</p>
<h3>Weight vs. time</h3>
<p>This week, I had to deal with a different challenge, <strong>the fuel and weight dilemma</strong>.  A few years ago, I never had to worry about this one: my Piper Warrior can carry 665 lb when the fuel tanks are full, and that was enough for my whole family of four, our dog, and luggage, so filling the tanks for every flight was a no-brainer.  Now my girls have grown into intelligent and beautiful women, and I&#8217;ve gone the other direction by putting on a few extra pounds, so I have to start thinking about fuel and weight.</p>
<h3>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>Here are the kind of options I consider before every flight:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Fuel</th>
<th>Endurance</th>
<th>Remaining load</th>
<th>Can carry</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48 gal</td>
<td>5:35</td>
<td>665 lb</td>
<td>Family and nothing else.</p>
<p>Three of us and 150 lb luggage.</p>
<p>Me and 455 lb luggage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>35 gal</td>
<td>4:00</td>
<td>743 lb</td>
<td>Family and 80 lb of luggage</p>
<p>Family, dog, and 40 lb of luggage</p>
<p>Three of us and 230 lb luggage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>24 gal</td>
<td>2:40</td>
<td>809 lb</td>
<td>Family, dog, and 105 lb luggage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 gal</td>
<td>2:10</td>
<td>883 lb</td>
<td>Family, dog, and 130 lb luggage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Additional considerations</h3>
<p>You have to consider a few points when looking over these choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is some stuff I <em>have</em> to carry in the plane — charts, Pilot Operating Handbook, tow bar, a couple of quarts of oil, some emergency supplies, cover, etc.  That stuff weighs at least 20 lb even when I strip it to its bare minimum, so out of a 40 lb baggage load, only 20 lb would be available for bags — that&#8217;s 5 lb each for four people.</li>
<li>People rarely fly naked (which is a good thing, given the average pilot&#8217;s age).  Even in the summer, clothes and shoes add an extra 5 lb per person, and people tend to carry purses or backpacks with food, books to read, etc., adding an extra 5 lb each.</li>
<li>For safety, you need to have a fuel reserve.  The minimum required is 30 minutes (45 minutes at night) VFR, and more, including fuel to get to an alternate airport, IFR.  For me, 2:40 fuel means at most a 1:40 flight VFR, and maybe 1:00 IFR, which isn&#8217;t enough to be useful for cross-country flying (a fuel stop every hour makes for a long flight).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are yet other considerations.  A lighter plane will take off in a shorter distance, climb faster, and cruise faster (I see a 5-10 knot difference in cruise speed between just me on board lightly loaded, and wallowing along at maximum gross weight).  It costs time and money to tanker extra fuel along, and could also be a safety issue on a short runway, if there are trees looming at the other end.</p>
<h3>The PIC&#8217;s burden</h3>
<p>As with the summer flying weather dilemma, there&#8217;s no automatic right answer for this: that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re pilot-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">in-command</span> — you have to think hard, and trade off one kind of safety or efficiency for another, hoping you&#8217;ve found the best balance.  Airline pilots worry about this even more than small-plane pilots do: someone once pointed out to me that for a 747, every takeoff is a short-field takeoff.</p>
<p>This week, I got my whole family to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYTZ">Toronto</a> and back safely, IFR both ways, landing with about 1:30 left in the tanks.  It was nerve-wracking having to do such careful fuel management, and telling Porter FBO in Toronto the exact number of litres to put in each tank (rather than &#8220;fill &#8216;er up&#8221;), but it worked.  My fuel burn was exactly as planned, we flew a bit faster for being light, and we got four adults back and forth in a 160 hp airplane.</p>
<p>Next week, it&#8217;s just me and the my 12-year-old Border Collie flying to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYAM/">the Soo</a>.  I&#8217;ve filled the tanks right up to the brim, and will fly the whole thing non-stop for four hours, IFR or VFR, while the old girl naps in the back seat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img align="right" width="300" height="225" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Cumulus_clouds_in_fair_weather.jpeg" /></p>
<p>On a typical VFR summer day in southern Canada or the northern US — the kind that the weather(wo)men call &#8220;a mixture of sun and cloud&#8221; with a decent amount of humidity — swirling columns of heated air, called <em>thermals</em>, start rising in the morning, and get higher and higher into the late afternoon as the sun warms the ground.  </p>
<h3>Clouds are the dividing line</h3>
<p>At the top of those thermal columns, like scoops of ice cream on top of invisible cones, scattered cumulus clouds form.  At first, those clouds might be only 1,000 feet thick and maybe 2,000 ft above the ground, but as the columns rise, the clouds get both higher and thicker, and some of them may develop into storm clouds during the afternoon (giving your typical cottage thunderstorm or 20-minute shower).</p>
<p>Underneath those clouds the horizontal winds are weaker, but the vertical motion of the thermals can cause a lot of turbulence — while the air may be smooth at breakfast, by early afternoon it can be rough enough to have passengers grabbing for the vomit bags, while the pilot feels like he or she is in a wrestling match with the yoke and rudder pedals.</p>
<p>Above the clouds, the air is normally smooth, but the winds are much stronger.</p>
<p>So where do you fly?</p>
<h3>Flying eastbound</h3>
<p>Eastbound, the best place to be is above the clouds if you (and your plane) can manage it. Prevailing summer upper winds in this part of the world are from the west or southwest, so on a good summer&#8217;s early afternoon you can get a 25-30 knot tailwind <em>and</em> smooth air at 9,500 ft eastbound.  What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>The problem is that the tops of those cumulus clouds keep getting higher and higher until almost supper time.  In Canada, you need oxygen to fly above 10,000 ft for more than 30 minutes, and the tops of summer cumulus clouds could hit that height anywhere between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm, even ignoring isolated storm clouds.  As the day goes on, without oxygen and a powerful plane, you hit a point that you can&#8217;t outclimb the clouds any more, and you&#8217;re forced to descend either into them (IFR) or under them (VFR), giving up some of the tailwind, and throwing you and your passengers back into the turbulence.</p>
<p>The good news is that, with the extra speed from the tailwind, you might be able to finish your trip before that happens.  It&#8217;s possible to fly a Piper Warrior from <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Ottawa</a> to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYYG/">Charlottetown</a> in well under four hours with a good tailwind, so you can leave early in the morning, fly non-stop, and land for lunch before the clouds (and turbulence) outclimb you.  Your passengers will have to put up with a bumpy descent and landing, but the rest of the flight will be smooth.</p>
<h3>Flying westbound</h3>
<p>Flying westbound, into the wind, you&#8217;re faced with a lose-lose proposition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fly below the clouds to get weaker headwinds, but subject your passengers to stomach-emptying turbulence as the day goes on.</li>
<li>Fly above the clouds to get smooth air, and watch your airspeed drop to (or below) automobile speeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>First thing in the morning, you have a good chance to find both smooth air and weak headwinds at low altitudes (e.g. 2,500 ft), but that won&#8217;t last until lunch.  As the cumulus clouds start to form, you&#8217;ll have to pick sides, diving down into the turbulence or climbing up into the headwinds.  And to throw extra salt into your wounds, the headwinds slow you down <em>and</em> make it more likely that you&#8217;ll have to make a fuel stop, slowing you down even more, and pushing your flight later and later into the afternoon and the worst of the turbulence and/or headwinds.  If you do decide to go above, even that won&#8217;t last: in a low-end plane without oxygen, you&#8217;ll eventually have to go down below and start banging your passengers&#8217; (and your) heads against the ceiling of your plane.</p>
<h3>Flying north- or southbound</h3>
<p>In Canada, it&#8217;s safe to say that most cross-country flying is on the east-west axis, since Canadian cities are spread out in a thin line along the US border.  In the US, on the other hand, you&#8217;re just as likely to be flying on the north-south axis (or something in-between).  In that case, if the upper winds are from the southwest (typical in summer, at least east of the Rockies), then flying southbound will be a lot like flying westbound, but with less severe headwinds, while flying northbound will be like flying eastbound, but with less beneficial tailwinds.</p>
<h3>Strategies</h3>
<p>I fly some passengers who suffer from motion sickness, so I spend a lot of time planning around this stuff.  In general, flying eastbound, I&#8217;ll go up above and accept a longer flight to get smooth air, since my passengers would rather be comfortable for 5-6 hours than violently ill for 3-5.  Still, I can&#8217;t protect them from the turbulence when I have to land (fuel stop or destination).</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t stay above all day when the sun&#8217;s out — today, coming back from Charlottetown, I started at 2,500 ft in air so smooth you could do calligraphy in the back seat, but by late morning ended up at 10,500 ft over Quebec&#8217;s Eastern Townships trying to stay above the rising cumulus layer. Once my 30 minutes above 10,000 ft were up, I had to descend and subject my passengers to 40 minutes of turbulence below the clouds at the end of the flight. </p>
<p>If your schedule can handle it, there are some workarounds to minimize the damage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start as early in the morning as possible, if there&#8217;s no fog or low stratus.  Some pilots I&#8217;ve met like to be preflighting as the sun rises.  If your family is willing to wake up at 5:00 or 5:30 am, go for it, and the flight will be more fun (plus you&#8217;ll have more of the day at your destination).</li>
<li>If your route follows a shoreline or a wide river, fly over water instead of land (staying within gliding distance).  Water tends to be cooler in the summer, and doesn&#8217;t throw up thermals as much.  Often, the best break through a line of thunderstorms will be over water, but don&#8217;t let yourself get pushed offshore.</li>
<li>Fly in the evening, especially if you have a well-lit destination for landing after dark.  Summer evenings are long-ish, and the air tends to start calming down again around 7:00 pm, give or take, as the ground cools, the thermals die out, and the afternoon cumulus clouds flatten out and disperse.</li>
<li>Split up the trip.  Instead of two three-hour legs with a fuel stop on your westbound flight, fly halfway, land before lunch, and spend the day.  The next morning (or that evening), fly the second leg in smooth air again.  For example, I could have flown from Charlottetown to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYQB/">Quebec City</a>, spent an afternoon and evening there, and then flown on to Ottawa the next morning.</li>
<li>Stay on top as long as possible, and descend quickly at your destination.  For passengers who suffer from motion sickness, popping ears are far preferable to a long time down low in turbulence.</li>
<li>Take up soaring.  Glider pilots love afternoon thermals, because the rising air lets them stay up almost indefinitely — that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll often see gliders happy circling under a cumulus cloud, while pilots of powered planes are impatient to be back on the ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, though, turbulence and headwinds are facts of summer flying, and not every day is a typical day — you could drag everyone out of bed at 4:30 or 5:00 am and still be in bumps the whole flight, and you could even end up with headwinds in both directions.  Don&#8217;t pressure yourself to make the flight perfect and control things outside your control: just do your best with whatever you have to work with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talking to ATC makes some pilots nervous &mdash; especially if they trained at an uncontrolled airport &mdash; but it&#8217;s actually pretty simple as long as you take a second to think before you push the PTT button, and compose your message in advance using the simple, Tarzan-like pattern <strong>&#8220;you, me, where, what&#8221;</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>who <strong>you</strong> (ATC) are</li>
<li>who <strong>I</strong> am</li>
<li><strong>where</strong> I am</li>
<li><strong>what</strong> I want</li>
</ul>
<p>Just repeat to yourself &#8220;you, me, where, what&#8221;; &#8220;you, me, where, what&#8221;; &#8220;you, me, where, what&#8221;.</p>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Consider this call for takeoff clearance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ottawa tower, Bravo Juliet Oscar short runway two two, ready for takeoff
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s break that down to &#8220;you, me, where, what&#8221;:</p>
<p>[you] Ottawa tower<br />
[me] Bravo Juliet Oscar<br />
[where] holding short runway two two<br />
[what] ready for takeoff</p>
<p>It&#8217;s short, complete, and professional-sounding (but try to resist the temptation to deepen your voice and talk in a slow southern drawl).  Here&#8217;s another one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Boston Centre, Cherokee Canadian Charlie Foxtrot Bravo Juliet Oscar 5 miles north of the Massena VOR, request flight following
</p></blockquote>
<p>That breaks down to exactly the same pattern:</p>
<p>[you] Boston Center<br />
[me] Cherokee Canadian Charlie Foxtrot Bravo Juliet Oscar (full form for the U.S.)<br />
[where] 5 miles north of the Massena VOR<br />
[what] request flight following</p>
<p>(If the frequency were busy, as it usually is with Boston Center, I&#8217;d break that down into two calls: an initial one with just the &#8220;you&#8221; and &#8220;me&#8221;, and a second with all the information when they called back and said &#8220;Bravo Juliet Oscar, go ahead your request&#8221;.)</p>
<p><!-- examples -->
</div>
<div id="uncontrolled">
<h2>Uncontrolled calls</h2>
<p>Sound familiar?  In fact, it&#8217;s exactly the same pattern you use in uncontrolled airspace:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Rockcliffe traffic, Cherokee Bravo Juliet Oscar five miles south at two thousand, crossing midfield to join the right downwind two seven
</p></blockquote>
<p>[you] Rockcliffe traffic<br />
[me] Cherokee Bravo Juliet Oscar<br />
[where] five miles south at two thousand<br />
[what] crossing midfield to join the right downwind two seven</p>
<p>For uncontrolled airports, though, it&#8217;s often considered good manners to add an extra &#8220;you&#8221; at the end, because many airports may share the same frequency.  A &#8220;you, me, where, what, you&#8221; pattern looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Rockcliffe traffic, Cherokee Bravo Juliet Oscar five miles south at two thousand, crossing midfield to join the right downwind two seven, Rockcliffe
</p></blockquote>
<p><!-- uncontrolled -->
</div>
<div id="variations">
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re just checking in with a new ATC unit after a handoff, the <em>what</em> is &#8220;checking in&#8221;, and you can usually leave that implied:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Toronto Centre, Bravo Juliet Oscar at six thousand
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it fits the pattern:</p>
<p>[you] Toronto Centre<br />
[me] Bravo Juliet Oscar<br />
[where] at six thousand (feet &mdash; to confirm that your encoder is working properly)<br />
[what] (implied: &#8220;checking in&#8221;)</p>
<p>Alternatively, if an ATC unit already has you in visual or radar contact, you can leave out the <em>where</em> and just say the <em>what</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Moncton Centre, Bravo Juliet Oscar request direct Fredericton VOR
</p></blockquote>
<p>[you] Moncton Centre<br />
[me] Bravo Juliet Oscar<br />
[where] (implied: &#8220;where you see me on radar&#8221;)<br />
[what] request direct Fredericton VOR</p>
<p>Finally, standard IFR practice after a handoff to a new ATC unit is to add the <em>what</em> (&#8220;with you&#8221;) before the altitude, changing the order slightly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Halifax terminal, Bravo Juliet Oscar with you at three thousand
</p></blockquote>
<p>[you] Halifax terminal<br />
[me] Bravo Juliet Oscar<br />
[what] with you<br />
[where] at three thousand [feet]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just because IFR pilots think they&#8217;re special.</p>
<p><!-- variations -->

<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/</a></p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/notams.rss">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/<strong>notams.rss</strong></a></p>
<p>You can subscribe to this RSS 2.0 feed using any standard blog reader,such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, filter and mash it up using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a>, etc.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>The huge advantage of reading NOTAMs in a blog reader is that your reader remembers which ones you&#8217;ve already read.  That way, when you plan a flight, you don&#8217;t have to reread the 20 NOTAMs you read for your flight three days ago.  If a NOTAM has been modified, then it will appear as unread again.</p>
<p>Nav Canada and the FAA <em>should</em> deliver NOTAMs this way automatically, as an cheap, easy way to improve flight safety &mdash; it&#8217;s too easy to miss one important new NOTAM when reading through 20 old, stale ones for the umteenth time.</p>
</div>
<div id="caveats">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Please read these &mdash; some of them are safety-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is just an experiment, not a regular feature: I may either drop it or change the way it works at any time, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to build a production-grade web app that relies on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airport NOTAMs only: FIC and HQ NOTAMs are not (yet) included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These NOTAMs are scraped from Nav Canada, so any minor change in the way they format their web pages could break the system completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These may not be up to date, and some NOTAMs may be missing, so unfortunately, you still have to go to the official source before an actual flight; however, this feed will help you keep up to date from day to day on what&#8217;s happening in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger airports have their own Nav Canada NOTAM files, but smaller airports are collected together into larger files.  You&#8217;ll see the whole file for each airport, not just the specific airport you requested (that&#8217;s a design choice).</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="incident">
<h2>The incident</h2>
<p><img src="/blogs/lahso/images/asi.jpg" align="right" alt="" /></p>
<p>I flew through some light snow showers on my way to Kingston with my daughter this morning, so I turned on the pitot heat just before joining the circuit to make sure the pitot blade was clear. At the end of the downwind leg I slowed the engine, reduced power, dropped flaps, verified 70-80 knot airspeed, turned a tight base over the icy water of Lake Ontario, then looked again at the airspeed indicator (ASI).</p>
<p>35 knots.  Way below stall speed.</p>
<p>But the plane was flying fine.  The nose wasn&#8217;t high, the controls weren&#8217;t mushy, the stall buzzer wasn&#8217;t blaring, the wings weren&#8217;t buffeting, and most importantly, the ice floes weren&#8217;t spinning and getting larger in the windshield.  I gently pushed the nose down enough to speed up 5-10 knots, but still the needle didn&#8217;t move.  I checked the altimeter and it was behaving properly, showing a slow descent towards field elevation.  That meant a pitot failure.</p>
<p>The trickiest part was the turn to final, almost immediately after the failure, when I&#8217;d barely had time to process it &mdash; it&#8217;s easy to lose airspeed in a turn, even with a functioning ASI.  After that, it was pretty much a normal approach and landing (no point declaring an emergency when the runway is less than a minute away).  The ASI flickered back to life on short final to show that I was 5-10 knots above my normal approach speed.  It froze again at some point during the flare and landing (I don&#8217;t look at the panel once I&#8217;m past the airport fence), then gradually climbed to 90 knots as I taxied in to park the plane.</p>
</div>
<div id="aftermath">
<h2>The aftermath and resolution</h2>
<p>I called an AME (mechanic) at the airport, tested the pitot system by blowing gently into it (no joy), then went out for lunch so that I wouldn&#8217;t stay around fretting.  Three hours later, the AME hadn&#8217;t had time to get to the plane yet, and the ASI still wasn&#8217;t responding to the blow test, so I decided to try something else (with the AME&#8217;s blessing): I started  the plane, turned on the pitot heat, then did a high-speed taxi down the 5,000 ft runway.</p>
<p>The needle climbed again during slow taxi, then dropped at the start of my high-speed run, then climbed up again &mdash; then, suddenly, at the very end, it started responding normally.  Since there was no other traffic, I turned around and did the same thing the other way, and this time, the needle responded normally the whole way.  I taxied around, did pre-takeoff checks, then went back to the runway for a real takeoff roll, prepared to abort halfway if the ASI wasn&#8217;t behaving &mdash; no problem at all, all the way home (though my mode C encoder started acting up, because there&#8217;s a law of physics that at least one thing always has to be broken on an airplane).</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis">
<h3>The analysis</h3>
<p>There must have been some snow or ice near the opening of my pitot blade.  Turning on the heat partly melted it and let it get into the (pin-sized) hole, and the water blocked the pitot line, possibly as slush or even a tiny ice crystal.  My high-speed taxis, combined with the pitot heat, forced the blockage the rest of the way through the line and cleared it.</p>
<p>Pitot heat on was a good idea, but turning it on just before joining the circuit wasn&#8217;t.  Lesson: make as few configuration changes as possible when you&#8217;re close to landing &mdash; if something&#8217;s already working, why mess with it?  If I&#8217;d turned on the pitot heat 10 or 15 minutes earlier, I would have had the ASI failure at 5,500 ft, where it was no risk at all, instead of in the most dangerous possible phase of flight, and it would have worked itself out before I had time to land anywhere.  Since I hadn&#8217;t turned it on earlier, I shouldn&#8217;t have turned it on at all.</p>
<p>In the end, no harm, no cost, and a little bit of extra confidence that I can handle a plane by feel when the ASI fails, at least in VMC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the U.S., in an attempt to avoid user fees for general aviation, AOPA (the main G.A. advocacy group) worked with the FAA to outsource flight services (briefings, VFR flight plans, etc.) to Lockheed-Martin.  AOPA didn&#8217;t realize that they were about to break the whole system.</p>
<p>The system broke badly &mdash; while some calls do get through, there are numerous reports of dropped calls, 30+ minute wait times, confused briefers, and more.  For U.S. pilots, it&#8217;s almost as if flight services has ceased to exist, and judging from discussion on the mailing lists, they&#8217;ve pretty-much stopped filing VFR flight plans (which aren&#8217;t mandatory in the U.S.) except when required for ADIZ or cross-border flights.</p>
<h3>Pilot, clear thyself</h3>
<p>Things have gotten so bad that there&#8217;s now a new wiki, <a href="http://www.clearancewiki.com/">ClearanceWiki</a>, devoted entirely to collecting information on how to pick up IFR clearances from small airports without having to call Flight Services &mdash; it lists radio frequencies or direct ATC phone numbers that are or might be available at each airport.</p>
<h3>When I couldn&#8217;t close my flight plan</h3>
<p>My own experience with Lockheed-Martin&#8217;s new U.S. FSS has been mixed.  I appreciate that I can now call from a Canadian landline or cell phone to reach U.S. flight services (when the FAA ran the system, non-U.S. area codes were blocked), and most of the time I have been able to get through (do foreign callers get better service?), but I&#8217;ve had some bad experiences.</p>
<p>The worst was last week, when I landed at Alexandria Bay/Maxson in Upstate NY to clear customs.  I had filed a cross-border VFR flight plan (as required by law), but Maxson has no RCO frequency, and I could not get through to anyone by phone to close the flight plan while my search-and-rescue time fast approached.  I decided that my best bet was to take off and climb until I could reach someone (I also had to pick up an IFR clearance for the rest of the flight, but it was VFR in Maxson).</p>
<p>Once in the air, I explained the problem to Wheeler-SAC approach at Fort Drum, and they started trying to reach FSS for me on their own dedicated lines, also with no success (they were able to give me my IFR clearance quickly, though).  Finally, I was high enough to pick up a Burlington RCO transceiver, and at the same time, Burlington had heard enough of a call from Wheeler-SAC (before the line went dead) to close my flight plan.</p>
<h3>Not ideal in Canada, but better</h3>
<p>While I&#8217;d rather not pay my ~$75 annual Nav Canada fee <em>and</em> the avgas tax, and I&#8217;m seriously p*ssed with the extra $10/takeoff fee coming up for using big airports like CYOW, we do get excellent FSS service here in Canada.  I almost never wait on hold on the phone for a Nav Canada briefer, and when I do, it&#8217;s usually a few seconds at most; in fact, a couple of times I&#8217;ve called Nav Canada from the U.S. to get a briefing because I can&#8217;t get through to U.S. flight services &mdash; they&#8217;re always understanding and happy to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, in the cold weather, my Warrior&#8217;s battery has barely managed one try starting the plane &mdash; any more, and it goes flat.  Most recently, it happened after I&#8217;d just been flying 1.7 hours and tried to restart after a short fuel stop.  I had to figure out whether the problem was the battery or the alternator (or regulator).</p>
<div id="checklist">
<h2>Battery/alternator diagnosis checklist</h2>
<p>I phoned my AME, and he gave me a short checklist that I could run myself using only a multimeter (this is for a plane with a 14 volt electrical system and a single battery):</p>
<ul>
<li>With the engine off, a reading at the battery terminals (master off) should give at least 12.5 volts, and a reading at the cigar lighter (master on, radios off) should give at least 11.5 volts.</li>
<li>With the engine idling, a reading at the cigar lighter should give 12.5&ndash;13 volts.</li>
<li>With the engine running at 1500 rpm, a reading at the cigar lighter should give at least 13.5 volts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="analysis">
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>I left the plane tied down for extra security (in addition to the brakes), and ran the tests.  Here&#8217;s what I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engine off: 12.42 volts at the battery terminals, 11.6 volts at the cigar lighter.</li>
<li>600 rpm: fluctuating 12.7&ndash;13.1 volts</li>
<li>1000 rpm: 13.71 volts</li>
<li>1500 rpm: 13.7 volts</li>
<li>2000 rpm: 13.7 volts</li>
</ul>
<p>After running the engine for a few minutes then shutting down, the battery read 13.03 volts at the terminals, but the charge had dropped to 12.61 only 10 minutes after I shut down the plane, and would presumably keep dropping to around 12.4 again.</p>
</div>
<div id="diagnosis">
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>My alternator is obviously producing full power even at only 1000 rpm, and the regulator is kicking in to cap it at 13.7 volts.  There&#8217;s no reason that battery shouldn&#8217;t be charged; however, 12.4 volts is fairly low, and more disturbingly, after only one start attempt, the battery drops to 12 volts and can no longer turn the propeller.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m facing a bad combination of cold weather and a weak battery.  I&#8217;ve decided to replace my wet cell with a newer, high-cranking-power sealed battery, but I need to wait for a new battery box cover to arrive from Concorde; in the meantime, I&#8217;m using a loaner wet Gill battery for an upcoming New York City trip.  If you see someone carrying a dead battery into the FBO to be charged while his family waits impatiently in the plane, it&#8217;s probably me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of months, I had two exceptionally good experiences with aviation-related businesses, and one exceptionally bad one.  As a service to my fellow owners, I&#8217;m going to name them all here.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Cheer: <a href="http://www.glapinc.com/">Great Lakes Aero</a></dt>
<dd>This company makes windows for light, unpressurized aircraft that are roughly triple the quality of the original manufacturers&#8217; at a third the price.  As if that weren&#8217;t enough, I bought a new windshield in May but didn&#8217;t get around to having it installed until December, when I found out that I&#8217;d bought the wrong thickness.  No problem: Great Lakes was happy to take it back and give me a refund (minus a trivial restocking fee) and ship me a new one.</dd>
<dt>Cheer: <a href="http://www.suttonaviation.com/">Sutton Aviation</a></dt>
<dd>This won&#8217;t be of much interest unless you keep your plane near Ottawa, but this year Sutton Aviation at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Rockcliffe Airport</a> showed me that an annual inspection (and associated upgrades, rectifications, and repairs) can be fast, thorough, <em>and</em> (relatively) inexpensive.  Maybe I can afford to keep this plane after all.</dd>
<dt>Jeer: <a href="http://www.aircraftspruce.com/">Aircraft Spruce</a></dt>
<dd>I was excited when I found out that Aircraft Spruce would be opening a Canadian operation, even if it&#8217;s just a transhipment point, because I&#8217;m tired of the cross-border mail order hassles.  I called Aircraft Spruce first to confirm that their deal with UPS meant no brokerage fees (&#8220;just tax&#8221;, said the man on the phone), then discovered when my package arrived that Spruce had simply collected the infamous, non-refundable $60&ndash;70 brokerage fee on UPS&#8217;s behalf <em>before</em> shipping you the order &mdash; how is that a benefit to Canadian customers?  They refused even to apologize afterwards, much less make good on their mistake (at first, they tried to claim that the fee was sales tax, until I pointed out the sales tax on a separate line).  Until we have a real Canadian source, other mail order companies like <a href="http://www.chiefaircraft.com/">Chief Aircraft</a> will be happy for your business, and will treat you better in the bargain.</dd>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My plane&#8217;s back on the line today.  After doing some high-speed taxi checks to make sure nothing was leaking or running too hot or cold, I had to try to push the plane back into its spot through snow and a small ditch, cover it up, and plug it in.  Call me slow (seriously &mdash; go ahead), but it took me until my fourth winter owning a plane to figure out some very simple tricks for moving, covering, and plugging in a plane in a snowy, slippery, uneven parking spot.</p>
<div id="fulcrum">
<h3>Fulcrum</h3>
<p>It is hard to move a plane by yourself on a slippery, paved surface; it&#8217;s <em>very</em> hard to move a plane onto uneven, snow-covered dirt and grass when standing on the slippery surface; and it&#8217;s <strong>extremely</strong> difficult to do so when there&#8217;s a small ditch where both the mains will get stuck.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I learned a trick for moving the plane when all else fails: use the ends of the wings for leverage.  If you push near the wing tip (on a spar rivet line, please), you can exert a lot of force on one side and move that wheel back while the nosewheel slides sideways on the ice or dirt, pivoting around the other main.  Keep alternating sides, and eventually you can wiggle the plane back into a spot.  Unfortunately, with the wheels in a ditch, the plane was pivoting around the wrong wheel and I wasn&#8217;t able to make any progress.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> chock the wheel on the opposite side so that it doesn&#8217;t slide forward when you want the wheel on your side to slide back, guaranteeing a secure fulcrum for your pivot.  Two or three runs back and forth with the chock, and I easily had the plane back in its spot.  I&#8217;m starting to think about buying a boat winch and using it to pull the plane back by its tail tiedown.</p>
</div>
<div id="fishing">
<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>Covering a low wing plane in the winter is tricky, because as the wing gets closer to the fuselage, you actually have to slide down on your back to get the strap from the back of the wing cover and pull it through.  This gets old, fast.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> Hook the strap by reaching under the wing with a telescoping snow brush or towbar and pulling it to you (I flew <em>how</em> many winters without figuring out this one?).</p>
</div>
<div id="cable">
<h3>Cable ties</h3>
<p>As much as possible, I want to keep the extension cord I use to plug in off the ground, because as the snow thaws and refreezes, the cord can end up buried under several inches of solid ice.  I&#8217;ve tried running it over the stabilator and wing, with a couple of loops around the step for good measure, but it still ends up drooping to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> run the electrical cord <em>underneath</em> the straps for the canopy cover and wing covers, so that they act as cable ties, holding the cord tight to the fuselage.</p>
</div>
<div id="routing">
<h3>Cord routing</h3>
<p>On the 1979 Warrior, large doors open on both sides of the cowling, so that you can actually see the whole ending compartment easily during preflight (you can even change the oil, oil filter, or a vacuum pump without uncowling the plane).  The receptacle for my engine heater is behind one of those doors, but I have to leave the door unlatched to bring the plug in.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> now that the electrical cord is securely strapped to the fuselage and won&#8217;t droop down, run it through the opening at the bottom of the cowling where the exhaust and oil tube are located, then pull it up to the receptacle.  Now the door can be securely latched.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading through an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotage">pilotage</a> [Wikipedia] in the December <cite>AOPA Pilot</cite>.  In general, I found the article enjoyable, but one thing stuck out like a wart &#8212; the author&#8217;s assumption that people should always read a chart track up (with the chart rotated for the direction they&#8217;re heading) rather than north up.</p>
<p>I have no objection to the suggestion that people <em>try</em> using a chart track up, but frequent claim that it&#8217;s easier &#8212; and some pundits&#8217; and instructors&#8217; insistence that it&#8217;s the <em>only</em> proper way &#8212; grates a bit.  In informal surveys on aviation mailing lists, I&#8217;ve found people split about 50:50 between north up and track up, and I suspect that it has to do with how different people&#8217;s brains work, something along the lines of left-handedness and right-handedness.</p>
<p>Personally, if I&#8217;m flying west, my mind already pictures me flying right to left, so it&#8217;s by far easier to hold the chart north up so that it lines up with what I&#8217;m seeing in my head.  Track up would be a double annoyance, since (1) I&#8217;d have to rotate everything in my head, and (2) all the text on the chart might be sideways or upside down.  Likewise, when I&#8217;m walking, cycling, or driving around a city, I think of myself as heading northwest, south, etc. &#8212; I never memorize a trip as a series of left or right turns.  I imagine that people who do navigate that way probably also find track up easier.</p>
<p>So if you fly, hike, boat, or whatever, do you prefer to hold your charts (or set your GPS display) north up or track up?  Why?  If you&#8217;re an instructor (aviation, seach-and-rescue, orienteering, etc.), have your students generally found one or the other easier?  Has anyone every done a proper scientific study?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is one really, <em>really</em>, <strong>REALLY</strong> important rule about winter flying near the Great Lakes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember which way the wind&#8217;s blowing.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/lakeeffect_seawifs_big.jpg"><img align="right" src="https://i0.wp.com/apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/lakeeffect_seawifs.jpg" alt="Lake effect snow." /></a></p>
<p>Even if there are blue skies everywhere else, a cold wind will often pull streamers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow">lake effect</a> weather off the Great Lakes, so if you&#8217;re downwind from (say) Lake Ontario or Georgian Bay, expect long streams of clouds with significant icing, snow, and low IFR conditions underneath, topping out somewhere around 6,000-8,000 feet (unless they hit hills like the Adirondacks, in which case the tops can shoot way, way up). This evening, the new photo of the day at Wikipedia <ins>(originally from NASA)</ins> is a beautiful colour satellite photo of streamers coming off the lakes (click on it for a much larger version), caused by what I&#8217;d guess is a low-pressure system centered in northern Quebec a bit east of James Bay.  Notice the long fingers reaching out into central Ontario (off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay), Michigan, Ohio, and upstate New York.</p>
<p>My normal flying route from Ottawa to Boston or New York takes me across the St. Lawrence River, and depending on the wind, I can usually expect to have to overfly lake effect weather somewhere along my route.  If the wind is from the west, I can expect to find it over Watertown, NY and the relatively flat area of NY state, possibly as far as Lake Champlain; if the wind is from the southwest, it will blow straight up the St. Lawrence towards Montreal, possibly boxing in Ottawa as well; if the wind is from the northwest, it will head towards the Adirondacks, and may throw up cloud too high for me to fly over; it will also blow off Georgian Bay across my route from Ottawa to Toronto, so even if the TAFs are CAVU for Ottawa and Toronto, it might be unflyable in between.</p>
<p>The trick in every case is to make sure that I can stay <em>above</em> the cloud, because it&#8217;s pretty nasty underneath it (not to mention inside). For emergencies, as you can see in the photo, there are usually clear spots between the streams for an emergency descent.  If the streamers are over your point of departure or destination, on the other hand, forget about it.  People on the U.S. side have it a lot harder in the winter, since the cold winter winds usually come from the northwest and blow over them on the southeast sides of the lakes.  Aside from central Ontario near Georgian Bay, the Canadian side is usually clearer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this posting from the courtesy computer at the Esso FBO in Toronto City Centre airport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_City_Centre_Airport">CYTZ</a>). I just finished a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Air">Hope Air</a> flight from Sault Ste. Marie (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sault_Ste._Marie_Airport">CYAM</a>), my fourth consecutive day of flying. Fortunately, I was able to fly in along and through today&#8217;s cold front before much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud">CB</a> developed, and what there was, I dodged with the assistance of my eyeballs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control">ATC</a>, and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_detector">StormScope</a>.</p>
<p>Coming into City Centre from the north, in and out of scud at the cloud bases, I had a chance to pull out and dust off a rarely-used tool: the <em><a href="http://avcan.blogspot.com/2005/04/contact-vs-visual-approach.html">contact approach</a></em>. I flew a contact approach in anger two years ago, after blundering into and escaping a small storm cloud — I had no desire for any further <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_meteorological_conditions">IMC</a> that day, so I dropped low and followed the St. Mary&#8217;s River into Sault Ste. Marie. This time was much more benign: after turning over the lakeshore heading towards City Centre, I was still unable to accept a visual approach due to restricted visibility (I got out of the scud by descending to 2,000). To make both my life and the busy controller&#8217;s easier, I offered to fly a contact approach. I could see the Scarborough bluffs clearly below me, so I simply followed the shoreline in until I saw the runway about 3-4 miles back.</p>
<p>This is exactly the situation that a contact approach is designed for. The arrival controller was able to hand me off earlier to City tower, easing his workload. Visibility underneath was adequate (&gt;3 SM), and the landing was a complete non-event. I knew the shoreline (and the two big smokestacks) well. In marginal VFR, a full approach would have been much more hairy, since I would have had to fly about 5-10nm out over the lake.</p>
<p>Controllers aren&#8217;t allowed to offer a contact approach, but it&#8217;s a useful thing to ask for sometimes. This afternoon, unfortunately, there&#8217;s a line of severe thunderstorms conveniently extending from here to my home base in Ottawa (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Macdonald-Cartier_International_Airport">CYOW</a>), so I guess I&#8217;ll spend a couple more hours checking e-mail and refreshing the radar page.</p>
<p><em>[Update: I made it home late in the afternoon, by picking my way along a wide corridor that opened up between two storm lines.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aviatrix&#8217;s latest post on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/myblogs/">flying up north</a> talks about crosswind landings.  When I was a student pilot, and for a while after I got my PPL, I found crosswind landings fairly difficult.  Then, one day, I suddenly realized that I&#8217;d just landed in a strong crosswind without thinking about it.  Much of what I learned during initial training turned out to be of limited value, so I decided to post what actually works for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost every landing is really a crosswind landing to some extent, so don&#8217;t think of <strong>The Crosswind Landing</strong> as a special procedure.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t set up the slip until you&#8217;re well below treetop/roof level, and preferably, not until you&#8217;re in the flare.  The winds at 100 ft (or even 50 ft or 20 ft) may have little or nothing to do with the winds you&#8217;ll be landing in.  I&#8217;ve often had a ferocious crosswind on the turn from base to final that faded to almost nothing by the time I touched down (even the windsock is too high to get the touchdown winds for a 172 or PA-28).</li>
<li>In the flare (for <em>any</em> landing), think of the controls differently &#8212; use the ailerons to slide the plane left/right so that it stays over the centreline, and use the rudder to keep the nose pointing straight forward. Don&#8217;t worry about a slip <em>per se</em> &#8212; it will just be the natural result of these inputs.</li>
<li>(Advanced) If the crosswind is very strong, back off on the rudder a bit and flare in a crab, then kick the rudder hard to straighten the nose just before the wheels touch. Don&#8217;t try this until you&#8217;re pretty comfortable (and probably never in a taildragger, unless you enjoy ground loops).</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I always land with full flaps, even in a strong crosswind.  The only time I don&#8217;t use flaps is when I&#8217;ve seen any trace of icing during flight &#8212; if, for some reason, there&#8217;s undetected ice on the stabilator/horizontal stabilizer, dropping flaps can cause a tail stall [<a href="http://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/courses/inflight_icing/related/3_2_3f_RI.html">video</a>], which is almost never recoverable close to the ground.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few times when pilots become especially self-conscious about being observed by others: when talking on the radio, when landing, and when starting the engine.  Of the three, as I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2005/07/19/starting/">written before</a>, starting a piston engine is by far the worst &#8212; you shout &#8220;CLEAR!&#8221; to make sure everyone on the crowded apron is watching, then deliver a loud commentary on your progress (or lack thereof) with a loud CHUFF-CHUFF-CHUFF-CHUFF.  If it goes on too long, people start either to stare at you, or even worse, to look away in embarassment.  Eventually, if the engine doesn&#8217;t fire, you stop for a while to let things cool down, then repeat the whole humiliating process.  At this point, a well-meaning instructor or mechanic might take pity on you and walk over to give you a hand, before both your battery and your ego run completely flat.</p>
<p>Hot starts can always be tricky, especially with fuel-injected engines, but winter starts have their own sets of problems.  This winter, however, I&#8217;m happy to report that my newly-overhauled engine has started on the first try every time, within 1-4 seconds of hitting the starter.  I&#8217;ve been leaving my Tanis heater plugged in, so that the whole engine is uniformly heated whenever I want to fly.  When I&#8217;m at a remote airport for a couple of hours, I keep my priorities straight, by putting the insulated cover over the cowl to hold in the heat <em>before</em> I put my own coat on.</p>
<h2>A different starting technique</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been using a different starting technique.  My first AME showed this to me a few years ago, but I didn&#8217;t fully understand it at the time; since then several other pilots have mentioned it on mailing lists (note that this applies to carbureted engines; it will be slightly different for fuel-injected:</p>
<ol>
<li>open the throttle all the way</li>
<li>close the mixture to idle cutoff</li>
<li>prime a few times (see below)</li>
<li>crank the engine</li>
<li>as soon as the engine fires, pull the throttle down to close to idle and push the mixture to full rich at the same time</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no fixed rule for how many times to prime &#8212; it depends on how warm the engine is, how your primer works, and how many cylinders have primer lines connected to them (since each squirt will be divided among all the cylinders).  In my Warrior, with three of four cylinders connected to the primer, I typically prime 3-4 times for a cold start and 1-2 times for a hot start. Flooding isn&#8217;t a big risk, since there&#8217;s no fuel flowing to the engine at first beyond what you supply manually with the primer.</p>
<p>My plane also has a reasonably new starter and copper (rather than aluminum) electrical wiring, both of which are important for starting.  My battery is near its last legs, and I should replace it soon to make sure my luck holds up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two points in a flight when people outside the plane tend to watch and critique you: when you start the engine, and when you land.</p>
<p>Granted, unless you&#8217;re hand-propping, a starting error is much less dangerous than a landing error; however, failed starts happen far more often, and there&#8217;s nothing like the grating &#8220;chuff-chuff-chuff-chuff&#8221; of a failed start to make all the airport old guys look over and shak their heads in dismay.</p>
<p><a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/">Aviatrix</a> has just posted two articles on starting carbureted piston engines, <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2005/07/piston-engine-starting-problems.html">here</a> and <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2005/07/escaped-comment.html">here</a>, and they&#8217;ve generated a good number of interesting comments.  Read them, if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently reading yet another review about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cockpit">glass cockpits</a> starting to appear in general aviation aircraft, when one comment struck me &#8212; the review mentioned how much pilots rely on the <em>position</em> of needles on analog (steam) gauges, rather than actually reading them.   That makes a lot of sense (and everyone else reading this probably knew it already) &#8212; I hand fly all of my IFR, since I don&#8217;t have an autopilot, and there&#8217;s no way that I could maintain altitude in turbulence, talk to ATC, look up approaches <em>and</em> scan my instruments if I had to actually read numbers on each of them.</p>
<h2>Altimeter</h2>
<p>The altimeter is a very straight-forward example.  In the following diagrams, I&#8217;ve drawn an altimeter face with all of the numbers removed and only the big (hundreds) hand.  For IFR, you&#8217;re almost always going to be flying on an even thousand, so while you certainly want to look at the little hand once in a while (a lot, if you&#8217;re in moderate-to-severe turbulence), most of the time all you&#8217;ll be doing is trying to keep the big hand pointing straight up.  If you glance quickly and see the needle in the first position, you&#8217;ll know that you&#8217;re slightly low, so you&#8217;ll add back pressure, power, or both.  If you see the needle in the second position, you&#8217;re fine (though it won&#8217;t hurt to glance at the VSI and ASI for trends).  If you see the needle in the third position, you&#8217;ll know that you&#8217;re slightly high, so you&#8217;ll release back pressure and/or reduce power until the needle looks like it does in the middle:</p>
<p><img src='https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/altifr1.png?w=640' alt='Altimeter IFR needle positions.' /></p>
<p>Note how little brain power this requires &#8212; the effort required to interpret the needle can be measured in tenths, if not hundredths of seconds, and you can often watch it with your peripheral vision while worrying about something else.  Exactly the same thing applies to a VFR cruise altitude, except that your goal is to keep the needle at the 6:00 position (since VFRs cruise at altitudes like 3,500 feet, 4,500 feet, etc.):</p>
<p><img src='https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/altvfr1.png?w=640' alt='Altimeter VFR needle positions.' /></p>
<h2>Airspeed Indicator</h2>
<p>I think that the same kind of approach works for the airspeed indicator.  While I&#8217;ve flown only a small range of very slow planes, from all the photos I&#8217;ve seen, approach speed is nearly always around 3:00, cruise is around 6:00, and middle of the yellow line (i.e. you&#8217;re close to tearing your wings off) is around 9:00:</p>
<p><img src='https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/asi2.png?w=640' alt='Airspeed indicator needle positions.' /></p>
<p>For my Warrior, 6:00 (straight down) is about 105 knots indicated, which is the expected IAS for 65% power.  Normally I cruise at 75%, which is about 114 knots indicated, or somewhere around 6:30; if I wanted to cruise at 55% power, I&#8217;d want to keep the needle a bit on the right side, around 5:30.  Normal approach speed is 70 knots (less for short field work or a light plane), which is almost right on 3:00.  9:00 is halfway between the yellow line and the redline, at 140 knots indicated.  Again, all I normally have to do is make sure that the needle is a bit past 6:00 &#8212; something I can check almost subconsciously and using peripheral vision &#8212; and I&#8217;ll know that my speed is OK.</p>
<h2>Vertical Speed Indicator</h2>
<p>The last major analog gauge with a needle is the VSI, and absolute position applies here just as much.  In the following diagram (again, without numbers), any pilot will recognize quickly that the first position shows a screaming dive, the second shows a normal descent, the third shows level flight, the fourth shows a normal climb, and the fifth shows a rocket-like climb (i.e. you&#8217;ve hit a mountain wave or blundered inside a big cumulus cloud):</p>
<p><img src='https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vsi.png?w=640' alt='VSI needle positions.' /></p>
<h2>That&#8217;s the Trick</h2>
<p>We spend a lot of time during IFR training on using the attitude indicator and turn coordinator to keep the wings level, and on using the VOR/ILS gauges and the ADF needle to navigate, but I think that the real breakthrough for each IFR student probably comes when he or she no longer has to think about these other needle positions, but can simply deal with them reflexively while thinking about the bigger problems.  IFR students feel rushed having only 10 minutes to get ready for an approach &#8212; a couple of years later, the biggest problem is how to entertain yourself during the extra 8 minutes.</p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into detail about glass cockpits, since I&#8217;ve never used them and would just be repeating things I&#8217;ve seen other people write.  However, it is worth noting that, for all the numbers and fancy graphics, the most important part of a glass display is the <em>bug</em> &#8212; it&#8217;s too hard for the pilots to keep reading numbers, so they set a bug (a triangle graphic usually, I think) on the ribbon displays for altitude, heading,  airspeed, descent rate, or what-have-you, then work just to keep the bug in the correct position.  Analog-type pilots sometimes have bugs on their heading indicators and use those the same way.  It all works out the same in the end, I guess.</p>
<h2>Followup</h2>
<p>A year later, I did log 0.5 flying behind a glass panel, and <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2006/02/08/cirrus-sr22-demo-flight-initial-impressions/">recorded my impressions</a>.</p>
