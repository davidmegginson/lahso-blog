										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve used the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23flightlog">#flightlog</a> to post information about my last two flights to Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
CYRO-CYAM VFR, 4.4 hours flight time (4.2 air time) PIC #flightlog
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
CYTZ-CYRO IFR 1.8 PIC in a PA-28-161 #flightlog
</p></blockquote>
<p>No one is using this hashtag for anything else, and it would make it easy for pilots to find other pilots on Twitter who&#8217;ve flown the same routes or used the same airports.  So far, of course, I&#8217;m the only pilot to find. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have added an experimental, alpha-quality feature to OurAirports: local Canadian Airport NOTAMs via RSS (scraped from the Nav Canada web site).  If anyone is interested in trying this out, you need to visit a Canadian airport&#8217;s page on the site and add &#8220;notams.rss&#8221; to the end of the URL, e.g.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/</a></p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/notams.rss">http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYVR/<strong>notams.rss</strong></a></p>
<p>You can subscribe to this RSS 2.0 feed using any standard blog reader,such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, filter and mash it up using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a>, etc.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>The huge advantage of reading NOTAMs in a blog reader is that your reader remembers which ones you&#8217;ve already read.  That way, when you plan a flight, you don&#8217;t have to reread the 20 NOTAMs you read for your flight three days ago.  If a NOTAM has been modified, then it will appear as unread again.</p>
<p>Nav Canada and the FAA <em>should</em> deliver NOTAMs this way automatically, as an cheap, easy way to improve flight safety &mdash; it&#8217;s too easy to miss one important new NOTAM when reading through 20 old, stale ones for the umteenth time.</p>
</div>
<div id="caveats">
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Please read these &mdash; some of them are safety-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is just an experiment, not a regular feature: I may either drop it or change the way it works at any time, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to build a production-grade web app that relies on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airport NOTAMs only: FIC and HQ NOTAMs are not (yet) included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These NOTAMs are scraped from Nav Canada, so any minor change in the way they format their web pages could break the system completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These may not be up to date, and some NOTAMs may be missing, so unfortunately, you still have to go to the official source before an actual flight; however, this feed will help you keep up to date from day to day on what&#8217;s happening in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger airports have their own Nav Canada NOTAM files, but smaller airports are collected together into larger files.  You&#8217;ll see the whole file for each airport, not just the specific airport you requested (that&#8217;s a design choice).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

					<description><![CDATA[Today I overhauled the search system in OurAirports to use Google&#8217;s free geocoding service.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I overhauled the search system in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> to use Google&#8217;s free <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html#Geocoding_Direct">geocoding service</a>.  <var>Geocoding</var> takes an address like &#8220;Algonquin Park&#8221; or &#8220;1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC&#8221; and converts it to a latitude and longitude &mdash; it doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it completely changes the way you can use OurAirports.</p>
<p>Previously, you could search for a town or city in OurAirports only if that city had an airport; for example, you could find Smiths Falls, Ontario, but not Perth, Ontario.  With geocoding, OurAirports shows the closest airports to <em>any address</em>, and that&#8217;s now the default search mode.  You can also filter the search results to show only airports with scheduled airline service, only seaplane bases, etc.</p>
<p>For example, for a <strong>commercial air traveler</strong>, here are <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/search?q=grand+canyon&amp;mode=geo&amp;show=scheduled">the closest airline airports to the Grand Canyon</a>; for a film-star bush pilot, here are the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/search?q=Hollywood%2C+California&amp;mode=geo&amp;show=seaplane">closest seaplane bases to Hollywood, California</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more information, and many more examples, on the new <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/help/searching.html">search help page</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, the name in the title sucks, but the good news is that <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> is now open to community contributions: any member can add a new airport or edit information about an existing one.</p>
<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re logged into your account (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/signup.html">sign up here</a>), you will now see an &#8220;edit&#8221; tab on every airport page, and an &#8220;<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/create.html">add a new airport</a>&#8221; link at the bottom of the left sidebar.</p>
<h2>Think locally</h2>
<p>OurAirports has excellent coverage for Canada, the U.S., and Brazil, but even then, we&#8217;re missing hundreds or thousands of private, unregistered landing fields.  For other countries, the coverage is uneven, and errors and missing information always need correction.  Now, if you live in Australia (for example), you can add missing Ozzie airports and correct or add information to existing ones, to make the site more useful for your fellow local pilots.</p>
<h2>Checking changes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m keeping an individual change history for each airport, and can roll back any changes that look spammy or wrong.  An amalgamated list of changes for all airports in inverse chronological order is available on the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/changes.html">site-wide change page</a> (also available as an <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/changes.rss">RSS feed</a>), and I&#8217;ll be grateful for help watching for any problems.  I also plan to add Wikipedia-style watchlists soon, so that you can be alerted about changes on airports that interest you.</p>
<h2>Open data</h2>
<p>Remember that I won&#8217;t hoard your contributions &mdash; the site&#8217;s full airport list, with data, is available in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/data/">CVS format for free, Public Domain download</a>, and updated every night.</p>
<h2>Unlike airport security &#8230;</h2>
<p>I plan to keep things simple and open as long as our community is small and there aren&#8217;t any serious spam attacks.  In the future, I can add moderation, recaptchas, etc. if necessary, but I don&#8217;t want to worry too much about problems that don&#8217;t actually exist yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a></strong> now includes heliports and floatplane bases as well as fixed-wing airports: in the last 24 hours I&#8217;ve added 828 floatplane bases and 5,911 heliports, all from Canada and the U.S. (and a couple of U.S. dependencies like Guam).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of a map of the Vancouver area &mdash; you should be able to make out 3 floatplane bases, 7 heliports, and 6 airports (you can jump to the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/big-map.html#lat=49.14758022506841,lon=-122.75848388671875,zoom=10,type=Map">live map</a> to explore further):</p>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="http://www.plews.ca/AirportsinCanada.htm">George Plews</a> for collecting the Canadian data.  Does anyone have a good reference for heliports and floatplane bases outside of Canada and the U.S. (or even for more fixed-wing airports)?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like Google Maps, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> now has a couple of easy ways to include your personal airport map in a blog posting or web page, YouTube-style:</p>
<ol>
<li>(easy) Click on the &#8220;Share this map&#8221; link at the top right of the map, then copy and paste the single line of HTML markup into your blog or web page.</li>
<li>(slightly more advanced) Use the KML link (also provided) to integrate with Google Earth, Google Maps, or other KML-enabled applications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s my current pilot map (it might not show up in RSS readers).  OurAirports will keep it up to date even after I make my posting:</p>
<p>If you want to make your embedded map a different size, just edit the values of the <var>width</var> and <var>height</var> attributes near the start of the line of HTML.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The most requested feature for OurAirports has been an ability to distinguish the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a pilot from the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a passenger.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most requested feature for <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> has been an ability to distinguish the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a pilot from the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a passenger.  It turned out to be fairly easy to implement.  If you&#8217;re logged in <strong>and you&#8217;ve checked the &#8220;pilot&#8221; box on the signin or member options page</strong> you&#8217;ll see a drop-down menu at the top of each airport page where you can specify how you&#8217;ve visited an airport:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a pilot</li>
<li>As a passenger</li>
<li>Both</li>
</ul>
<p>On your personal map page, you can now select (just above the map) to see all the airports you&#8217;ve visited, only the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a pilot/flight crew, or only the airports you&#8217;ve visited as a passenger (or not specified).  All of these can be bookmarked. Here are <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/">all my airports</a>, the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/?role=pilot">airports I&#8217;ve visited as a pilot</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/?role=passenger">airports I&#8217;ve visited as a passenger</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the FAA or Transport Canada, so there are no regulations to fuss over &mdash; <em>you</em> get to decide for yourself what constitutes being a pilot (PIC? SIC? taking the yoke for 10 minutes in cruise?) or passenger, or even visiting an airport (maybe just shooting an approach or doing a touch-and-go?).</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s the controversial part&#8230;</h3>
<p>Changes are never painless once a site has a lot of members.  OurAirports members have already clicked the &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here&#8221; checkbox for different airports many thousands of times, and I know that some of you (especially those who&#8217;ve entered several hundred airports) would not appreciate having to go back to all of them and enter &#8220;pilot&#8221; manually, so here&#8217;s what I did: if (and only if) you checked that you are a pilot, I automatically set the role of all the airports you&#8217;ve visited as &#8220;pilot&#8221; &mdash; that way, you have to go back and change only the ones that you visited as a passenger (airline, GA, or even city bus if you like) or as both a passenger and pilot on separate occasions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, until you make that change, it might look like spinning some grandiose claims, e.g. you&#8217;ve flow as pilot not only to Tallgrass Field and Hicksville Regional, but also to Atlanta, Heathrow, JFK, SFO, LAX, and Charles de Gaulle &mdash; pretty good for a student pilot in a Cessna 152!  If anyone is worried about that, please let me know, and I can reset all of your airports to &#8220;unspecified&#8221; using a simple database query.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time today, while I was in the air over Ottawa taking my 24-month IFR renewal flight test (passed), <a href="http://www.ourairports.com">OurAirports</a> ticked past 100 registered members.  People are leaving so many comments that I can barely keep up with reading all of them, and there are many maps I haven&#8217;t looked at yet.  The personal airports-visited maps I <em>have</em> seen are fascinating &mdash; most pilots have clusters around their home airports, with a few further away from long cross countries, but some follow other patterns, like long, east-west lines.  A few have made maps of their airline travel, and I plan on giving a way soon to distinguish airports visited as a passenger from airports visited as a pilot.</p>
<p>By the way, the 100th member was <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/MarkAnd/">MarkAnd</a>, who&#8217;s done most of his flying in Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  At the time of writing, we have 103 members in total.  Thanks to MarkAnd and to everyone else who&#8217;s contributed to the site.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve moved the site to a fast, dedicated server, and the performance problems seem to be over.)</p>

If the site was too slow when you first visited, you might want to take a second look and see if it&#8217;s better.</p>

<h2>XingR&#8217;s notes from a lifetime of flying</h2>
<p>Enough tech talk.  You&#8217;re here to read about flying, and whether you&#8217;re a new student or a 20,000-hour airline pilot, I think you&#8217;ll enjoy reading the beautiful comments &mdash; mini-essays, really &mdash; that OurAirports member <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/XingR/">XingR</a> has been contributing about his lifetime spent in and around airports on several continents, both in civilian life and through a long military career (he&#8217;s currently living near <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/RPLC/">Clark Intl</a>, the former huge U.S. military base in the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/PH/">Phillipines</a>).  You can read all of XingR&#8217;s comments (in reverse order) on his <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/XingR/comments.html">comments page</a>, and follow the links to see the airports.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve written a web site called OurAirports that lets you make a map of the airports you&#8217;ve visited (either as a pilot or as a passenger, your choice). Here&#8217;s my personal map &#8212; note that you can share your maps &#8230; <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2007/07/17/make-a-web-map-of-the-airports-youve-visited/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/"><img height="250" width="400" style="float:left;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;" src="/blogs/lahso/images/ourairports.png" alt="My airport map" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a web site called <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">OurAirports</a> that lets you make a map of the airports you&#8217;ve visited (either as a pilot or as a passenger, your choice).  Here&#8217;s my personal map &mdash; note that you can share your maps with anyone, not just other members:</p>
<pre>
<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/">http://www.ourairports.com/members/david/</a>
</pre>
<p>To make your own map, set up a free account (takes about 30 seconds), then just click in the &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here!&#8221; box on each airport&#8217;s page.  You can also browse the airports of the world on <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/big-map.html">The Big Map</a> or <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/world.html">drill down geographically</a>.  My favourite, though, is <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/random">warping to a random airport</a>.</p>
<div id="help">
<h2>Please help a bit&#8230;</h2>
<p>This is just a web site, not a startup &mdash; sadly, there aren&#8217;t enough of us to build a real business out of this.  But there&#8217;s no point spending any more time on it if the site&#8217;s not fun, so if you don&#8217;t do anything else please <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/">visit the site</a> and let me know what I could do to make it more fun for <strong>you</strong> as a pilot, airline passenger, GA passenger, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-more">
<h2>&#8230; and a bit more &#8230;</h2>
<p>If you feel like helping even more, I&#8217;d be grateful if you could show the site to other people who like flying and find out what they think of it.  The site lets you leave comments on airports, like <a href="http://www.airnav.com/">AirNav.com</a> does, except that it includes airports outside the U.S. and doesn&#8217;t force you to attach comments to a specific FBO.  The more comments people leave, the more useful the site is.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-more-more">
<h2>&#8230; and even more?</h2>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re <em>really</em> hardcore helpful (or you&#8217;re stuck in a long layover with nothing else to do), here are some of the things I&#8217;m thinking about for the next step, and I&#8217;d love to hear people&#8217;s preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let people categorize airport comments (FBO, wifi, fuel, food, ground transpo, etc.) so that it&#8217;s easier to find information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up editing and moderation privileges, so that members can add and correct airport (and maybe navaid?) data to keep it current.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add forums for organizing fly-ins, buying or selling used stuff (tools, GPS, plane, whatever), or even ride boards linked to individual airports, so that you can see what&#8217;s going on in your area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add navaids, fixes, and basic flight-planning support (draw lines on the map) &mdash; this would appeal only to pilots, of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add bulk entry of airports, so that you can just type all the IDs of the airports you&#8217;ve visited into a textarea instead of going to each airport page and clicking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export airport data in GPX format, so that you can load it into your GPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let members upload GPS tracks to the site, so that they can be displayed on the map and shared with other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the usual airport data that other sites have (runway lengths, frequencies, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to dig up information on airline schedules and link it to the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give up on the whole idea and do something useful with my free time.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Gunner <strong>William Henry Ranson</strong> (born 1843) has started a blog about his life in the ranks of Royal Artillery and as a civilian in Canada right after Confederation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code><a href="http://whranson.blogspot.com/">http://whranson.blogspot.com/</a></code>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gunner Ranson was my great-great-grandfather.  After serving in the Royal Artillery during the 1860s, he ended up settling in Canada permanently in the 1870s.  While many British officers kept diaries and wrote memoirs, very few men of the ranks did &mdash; although a good number could read and write, few had the inclination and the available time (and light) to do so &mdash; but my great-great-grandfather was an exception.  While we don&#8217;t have the original diary, we do have a summary that he wrote later in life as a memoir, based on the lost diary, giving a working man&#8217;s view of both the British military and of later civilian life (often more brutal) in Victorian Canada.</p>
<p>My brother Tom has had the memoir for some years and has been trying to decide the best way to edit and publish it.  In the end, he has decided to publish sections serially as a blog.  I encourage anyone interested in British or Canadian history to read this.  The blog format reminds me very strongly of the serial magazine publication common during the Victorian period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=""><img src="/blogs/lahso/images/plane-tree.jpg" align="left" alt="Plane in tree." /></a></p>
<p>[<em><strong>Update:</strong> see below.</em>]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/airplane/flightschool.asp#photo">According to Snopes</a>, this photo is legit &#8212; it&#8217;s a Cherokee 180 <a href="http://www.airport-data.com/aircraft/N6487J.html">N6487J</a> that crashed into a tree during a forced approach near <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-K00V/">Meadowlake Airport</a> in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/CO/">Colorado</a> last month after the engine lost power (the pilot, who was the sole occupant, had no serious injuries).</p>
<p>The picture is circulating around the Internet because of the funny juxtaposition of a flight school sign and a small plane crashed into a tree behind it.  However, <a href="http://www.meadowlakeairport.com/AmericanAviation.html">American Aviation</a> uses Cessnas as its primary trainers (and a Piper Arrow for complex training), and the PA-28-180 in the picture is registered to a real-estate company, so unless it was on a lease-back, it really has nothing to do with the flying school or flying lessons.  Still, it is hard not to come up with funny captions &#8230;</p>
<div id="update">
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>I received an e-mail from Mark at Meadowlake Airport pointing me to the <a href="http://www.meadowlakeairport.com/INDEX2.html#element1025">story on the airport&#8217;s web site</a>.  The story clears up a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pilot was practicing night circuits (I&#8217;m surprised by that, since the crash happened at 5:30 pm, at a relatively southerly attitude, and official night doesn&#8217;t being until 30 minutes <em>after</em> sunset).</li>
<li>The plane was a rental, but not from American Aviation (it just happened to crash into a tree near their entrance).</li>
<li>The pilot suffered no injuries at all in the crash, but was slightly hurt climbing down from the tree.</li>
<li>The plane hit power lines (visible in the picture) first during an attempt to glide to the runway, then ended up in the tree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tree probably did a good job dissipating the plane&#8217;s energy and saving the pilot. If it was already dark (say, because the sun had gone behind mountains), the power lines would have been awfully hard to see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[Update 2006-11-20: it looks like they&#8217;ve pulled even the small amount of Canadian data that they can get from the FAA database &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing but US airports and navaids in there now.]</em></p>
<p>Well, the DAFIF &#8212; the free database of worldwide aeronautical information that used to be available free from the U.S. Department of Defense &#8212; has been gone for a few weeks, and it&#8217;s having repercussions that I hadn&#8217;t anticipated.  It turns out that the most popular flight planning web site, <a href="http://www.aeroplanner.com/">Aeroplanner</a>, was using the DAFIF for their non-U.S. data, so Canada has suddenly gone blank: aside from a few major airports and navaids that happen to be in the FAA database, and the segments of a few airways crossing the border, the airways, intersections, navaids, airports, terminal airspace, control zones, restricted airspace, and everything else that used to crowed their online maps is gone, leaving the site useless for anyone (Canadian or American) planning a flight that doesn&#8217;t stay entirely within U.S. airspace.  The company graciously offered me a pro-rated refund for my subscription, though I decided not to take them up on it.</p>
<p>Lots of other people use the DAFIF for cheap or free flight planning, for controlling aircraft in flight simulators, and much more.  In many cases, they can keep using the last public edition, which will slowly get more and more out of date, but that obviously wouldn&#8217;t be a responsible choice for a real-world online flight planning service like Aeroplanner.</p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s the real villain?</h2>
<p>So who should we be mad at? The U.S. DoD is an obvious target, since they&#8217;re the ones who pulled the data from public use, but let&#8217;s step back and think for a second:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the U.S., the FAA still publishes a free database for American airspace, with a bit of Mexican and Canadian thrown in.</li>
<li>Almost every other country in the world refuses to release its air navigation data free to the public, period.</li>
<li>The U.S. military used to make up for that by publishing a lot of every <em>other</em> country&#8217;s airnav data as well.</li>
</ol>
<h2>No more charity</h2>
<p>Sure, I wish they still published the DAFIF (and I suspect their reasons for stopping are silly), but the real villains here are the Canadian government, the British government, the Australian government, and every other government that refuses to release free information to their own citizens about their own airspace.  We were lucky that the U.S. DoD was willing to help cover that disgraceful gap for so many years, and that they have given us a good starting point for a free,collaborative airnav database (we still have the last DAFIF edition to start from), but our years of living off American charity have now ended.</p>
<h2>A new start?</h2>
<p>Speaking of free, collaborative databases, Paul Tomblin has set up a <a href="http://xcski.com/navdata/bin/view/DAFIFReplacement/WebHome">wiki</a> to start discussing life after DAFIF.  Why not swing by and take a look.  And don&#8217;t be surprised if, in the meantime, your favorite flight planning tool suddenly turns Canada into the huge, empty white space that the rest of the world always imagined it was.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Aviatrix is not a quitter &#8212; see below.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update #2:</strong> I think the <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2006/08/23/physical-limitations/#comments">comments</a> are better than my posting, so you might want to skip ahead and read them first (especially the third one).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update #3:</strong> She got <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2006/08/horsepower.html">back behind the yoke</a> and did great.</em></p>
<p>After learning the basics of handling an airplane and working in the system, flying is largely about two things: weather, and personal <ins>physical</ins> limitations.  Weather (which I&#8217;ve discussed in other postings) is something that you can learn by studying, but <del>personal</del> <ins>physical</ins> limitations are things that you stumble upon, sometimes fatally, but always unexpectedly.</p>
<h2>Finding limitations</h2>
<p>Some limitations are obvious &#8212; we all know that we cannot live more than a few days without water, that we cannot jump off tall buildings and fly to the ground, and that we will not survive a collision standing in front of a speeding train.  Other limitations are trickier, because they are not the same for every person, or change for different times and circumstances.  After four hours at 10,000 feet without supplemental oxygen, is your flying impaired?  Never?  Always?  Sometimes?  It&#8217;s a crap shoot.  Put two pilots side by side, and one might be able to solve differential equations in her head, while the other can no longer remember his girlfriend&#8217;s last name.  Maybe tomorrow it will be the other way around.  Ditto for spatial disorientation, fatigue, and the other physical limitations that sometimes sneak up and kill pilots.  How long can you hand-fly in IMC and moderate turbulence?  Once I did eight hours with no problem; another time, I was physically trembling after four, and had to ground myself and call in help to get a Hope Air patient back home.  Good flying is learning to fly safely and well as the pilot you are, not trying to force yourself to become the pilot you wish you were.</p>
<h2>Aviatrix and the smoke</h2>
<p>All of this is leading up to the latest posting from my favorite blogger, a Canadian commercial pilot who goes by the pseudonym <em>Aviatrix</em>.  In her posting <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/2006/08/effects-of-smoke.html">Effects of Smoke</a>, she describes the end of a long series of events that led to her <del>decision to resign her job and quit flying altogether</del> <ins>being fired from her job and deciding to take time to consider her future in aviation</ins>.  Flying low, through dense forest-fire smoke (she reported less than a mile visibility) without supplemental oxygen, her sense of judgement became impaired and she had trouble flying the plane, to the point that her first officer had to take over control to make a safe landing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s good news and bad news here.  The good news, obviously, is that she lived to blog about her experience.  The bad news is that she blames herself and has lost <ins>some of</ins> her confidence to fly.  She never even considers the smoke itself (hypoxia or CO poisoning) as a cause, probably because her first officer seemed unaffected by it, and even now she does not want to admit any physical weakness in the face of the male-dominated world of northern flying.  The thing is, personal limitations are kind-of random.  For example, consider another male-dominated world, firefighting, where the participants are much more physically fit than the average pilot.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt from an <a href="http://www.ilo.org/encyclopedia/?doc&amp;nd=857200213&amp;nh=0">article about firefighting hazards</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Over 50% of fire-related fatalities are the result of exposure to smoke rather than burns. One of the major contributing factors to mortality and morbidity in fires is hypoxia because of oxygen depletion in the affected atmosphere, leading to loss of physical performance, confusion and inability to escape.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Compare that to Aviatrix&#8217;s posting.  Sound familiar? Huge, muscular, testosterone-soaked male firefighters exposed to smoke sometimes become as helpless as babies, and their buddies have to pull them out.  It&#8217;s not a girl thing.</p>
<h2>Next steps?</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, without knowing Aviatrix personally, she&#8217;s a highly-skilled and experienced pilot who ran hard into a physical limitation for dealing with hypoxia.  Does that mean she&#8217;s now unsafe to fly?  Of course not.  If anything, it means that she can become an even better pilot, because she&#8217;ll know herself more thoroughly than she did before.  She&#8217;ll know the early signs of hypoxia from bitter experience, and will (perhaps) grab a small portable oxygen bottle from her flight bag or, if up high and not in smoke, choose a lower altitude before things deteriorate.  She&#8217;ll cancel a flight that she might have decided to fly before, and will be more confident about her decision.  And her passengers will have a much better chance of a safe landing than they would with most of the bold, young male northern pilots who yet to discover <ins>how non-negotiable</ins> their own <del>personal</del> <ins>physical</ins> limitations <ins>will be</ins>.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m safe in wishing Aviatrix luck from <em>all</em> of her readers.  I, for one, would not hesitate to get onto a plane where she was PIC &#8212; odds are, she&#8217;ll be the safest pilot at any base &#8212; and I hope to read more of her flying stories soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big engine can cause problems: it burns <em>lots</em> more gas, resulting in higher operating costs and a shorter range (relative to a smaller engine on the same plane); it weighs more, reducing your useful load and complicating weight and balance; and it has more cylinders and other parts to inspect, repair, and overhaul, resulting in higher ownership costs.</p>
<p>A big engine can also bring a lot of joy: it gives you the option of climbing above problems (icing, turbulence, clouds, mountain waves); it can let you fly faster into a brutal headwind (by trading off some range); it gives you more power for takeoff, reducing distances and <em>increasing</em> your useful load; and most importantly, if your airplane is a radio-controlled model, a grossly overpowered engine allows you to do some pretty neat tricks, as shown in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gulv_bvZS94">this video</a> on YouTube.</p>
