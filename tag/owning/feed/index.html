<p>Today I flew my plane home from <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYKF/">Waterloo</a> to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Ottawa</a> with a brand-new autopilot installed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve flown over 850 hours, about 120 of them in actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_meteorological_conditions">instrument conditions</a>, and all by hand.  I&#8217;m proud that I can do that, but at the same time, it&#8217;s tiring: after 8 hours bumping around in cumulus clouds and dodging storms on the Stormscope, I&#8217;m exhausted beyond anything I&#8217;d ever imagined.  Even 4 hours in good VFR weather can be tiring, because of the constant attention needed to keep the plane straight, level, and on course.</p>
<h2>Choosing an upgrade</h2>
<p>I knew it was time to improve rather than just maintain my plane, and I also considered an IFR GPS and a new paint job (both about the same cost), but the autopilot gave me the biggest safety and operational benefits for the money.  I called a few places for quotes, but the only one that answered my calls and questions consistently was <a href="http://www.kitcheneraero.com/">Kitchener Aero</a>, where owner Barry Aylward went out of his way to carry on a friendly e-mail and phone correspondence for half a year while I hemmed and hawed, then fit me right in as soon as I made up my mind, as if I were one of his bizjet customers rather than a tight-fisted Cherokee owner.</p>
<p>I decided on the <a href="http://www.s-tec.com/Documentation/Shared%20Documents/Product%20Brochures/sys_20-30.pdf">S-TEC System 20</a>, a rate-based autopilot (much smoother and more reliable than old APs) that is built into a turn coordinator, and replaces that instrument on my panel without needing any extra space.  The S-TEC 20 is a <em>single-axis</em> autopilot &mdash; that means that it controls roll (and heading), but not pitch (and altitude) or yaw.  Barry warned me that I&#8217;d wish I&#8217;d paid a few thousand extra for the S-TEC 30 with altitude hold, but I was already close to my spending limit, and knew I&#8217;d end up asking for extra maintenance work on my existing avionics (and a new <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp13918-tp13918-5309.htm">406 MHz ELT</a>, since the plane was there anyway &#8230;).</p>
<h2>Using the autopilot</h2>
<p>Kitchener Aero sent me up on a test flight with one of its people, ready to adjust the autopilot, but it was absolutely perfectly tuned.  While the S-TEC 20 can&#8217;t hold an altitude, here&#8217;s what it <em>can</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the wings level, and allow simple, stable turns using a knob (without risk of overbanking).</li>
<li>Track a heading set on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_indicator">heading indicator</a>.</li>
<li>Track a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range">VOR</a> radial inbound or outbound.</li>
<li>Track a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localizer">localizer</a> on a LOC or ILS approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to try all of these during the test flight northwest of Waterloo (except for the LOC tracking, due to a miscommunication with Waterloo tower).  Unlike GPS tracks, VOR needles tend to <em>scallop</em> &mdash; wag back and forth &mdash; and an autopilot that overreacts to that will soon make the passengers (and pilot) seasick with all the rocking.  The S-TEC 20 responded very gently, and almost unnoticeably, to the scalloping, even close to the VOR.</p>
<h2>First cross-country with an autopilot</h2>
<p>During my flight home, I had a chance to use both modes for a bit over two hours.  I used VOR-tracking mode to track northeast outbound from Waterloo, then heading mode (with frequent adjustments) to fly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment">DME</a> arc just outside Toronto terminal airspace until I could join my airways, then back to VOR-tracking mode as I followed the airways and switched from VOR to VOR.  Up at 9,500 ft, above the broken layer of cumulus cloud, the air was smooth as silk, and I was able to fly hands off with only an adjustment every 5 minutes or so to the elevator trim to hold altitude.  Barry was wrong &mdash; I wasn&#8217;t missing altitude hold at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, summer is summer, and eventually, the cloud layer <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/07/the-summer-flying-dilemma/">rose up to meet me</a>.  I had to descend down below it, and my nice smooth flight became a mechanical rodeo bull.  The autopilot still did a good job holding heading and tracking the VORs, though the turns in turbulence were more aggressive and noticeable, but I found myself trimming every 30 seconds or so as my pitch and altitude shot up and down in rising and falling air columns.  Barry was right &mdash; in the turbulence, I wished I had altitude hold.  </p>
<p>The good news is that the S-TEC 20 can easily be upgraded to an S-TEC 30, which <em>does</em> support altitude hold and electric trim.  Maybe in a year or two.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>I think the autopilot is going to be a big part of my flying from now on.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed the bragging rights of always hand-flying, but 9 years of bragging is enough.  Besides, if flying is less tiring, maybe I&#8217;ll do more of it, and travel further: the prairies, the Arctic, the Mississippi, even the Florida Keys and the West Coast are all out there waiting for me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a six month break from flying &mdash; basically, work, a long wait for new fuel caps at my annual, and a family vacation in London (UK) got in the way.  I also managed to prove the third rule of aviation (after the <em>large-fortune</em> and <em>old-bold pilots</em> ones):</p>
<blockquote><p>
You can have enough time to fly, or enough money to fly, but not both.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>Changes in work</h2>
<p>Consulting work has been wonderful crazy busy for me and pretty-much every other consultant I know, whether in IT, business, aid work, development, or what-have-you.  Canada barely got brushed by the recession that devastated the US in 2008-09 (with record-high property prices in most of our big cities, it may be that our bubble just hasn&#8217;t burst yet).  The problem is that my customers are mostly in Canada and the UK now &mdash; the US economy isn&#8217;t so great, remember &mdash; so I don&#8217;t have work excuses to fly down to Boston, NYC, Washington, etc. like I used to.</p>
<h2>Recency Lost</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never taken such a long break before.  After six months away from flying, bad things start to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&#8217;t fly IFR, because you have to have done six hours real/simulated IMC and six approaches within the last six months (the infamous 6-6-6).</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t carry passengers at night, because you have to have done five takeoffs and landings at night within the last six months.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t carry passengers during the day, even other pilots, because you have to have done five takeoffs and landings (any time) within the last six months.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recency Regained (part 1)</h2>
<p>So now it&#8217;s a matter of crawling my way out of the hole, milestone by milestone, until I can get back to my regular IFR/cross-country kind of flying.  I started by calling my flying buddy Mike Hopkinson and asking for an intervention, and he complied by texting me last Saturday to remind me to get to the @#$% airport and then meeting me after his shift on dispatch.  I uncovered the plane, made some stupid mistakes trying to start it (yes, it does help to check the fuel cutoff), recharged the battery that I drained, then did my normal post-maintenance checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long, thorough preflight, including control movements.</li>
<li>Confirm that the engine compartment is clean (I even took a picture for before/after comparison).</li>
<li>Do a 5-minute lean ground-runup, and watch for anomalies.</li>
<li>Do a high-speed taxi down the runway to check what happens as the controls become effective.</li>
<li>Shut down and search for stains, leaks, cracks, or anything else that shouts <strong>DON&#8217;T FLY!</strong></li>
<li>Start up again and fly circuits, always within gliding distance of the runway.</li>
<li>Shut down and repeat the stain/leak/crack checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plane passed with flying colours (so to speak &mdash; my paint scheme is drab), and I managed five touch-and-go landings in a crisp cross-wind, progressing from &#8220;what-the-hell-was-that?&#8221; on the first to &#8220;now I&#8217;ll gently lower the nosewheel exactly on the centreline&#8221; on the fifth.  It turns out the the rules make sense &mdash; 5 really is the magic number, and now I was legal to carry passengers in day VFR.</p>
<h2>Victory lap to Toronto and back</h2>
<p>As soon as I was done that and mentioned it on Facebook, my older daughter asked me if I could pick her up in Toronto and bring her home for a break from her studies at U of T.  It grated to be a VFR-only pilot, but the weather on Friday co-operated beautifully, so I managed to get 4 hours of proper cross-country flight time (3.6 hours air time) on a beautiful spring day.  I was ridiculously nervous beforehand, but on the day of, my flying and radio work through the busy Ottawa and Toronto airspace was fine, and the flight was as boring and uneventful as I want all my flights to be (my rule is that the only excitement in flying should come from the scenery outside the window).  No new milestones from that flight, but I feel confident now to start back into the night and IFR work &mdash; 2 more milestones to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m late on this (sorry, other air-bloggers), but here goes &#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Expand my horizons.</strong>  This year, I pushed my southern limit a bit by flying all the way south to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KIAD/">Dulles Airport</a>.  My other extremes flying from Ottawa are <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYAM">Sault Ste. Marie</a> to the west, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYBC/">Baie Comeau</a> to the north, and <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYPD/">Port Hawkesbury</a> (Cape Breton) to the east. Maybe this is the summer I&#8217;ll fly up to Hudson Bay, just for the hell of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seriously consider taking on one or two partners for my Warrior.</strong> It&#8217;s a lot of work taking care of an airplane, and it could be fun to share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ace my IFR renewal and my medical.</strong> I did my last medical when I was 39, so it was good for five years.  My last IFR flight test was in 2007, and was good for two years.  They both come due this summer/fall, and the medical will be every two years from now on (since I&#8217;m over 40).  Recurrent training will help with the first one, and exercise and healthy eating will help with the second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t get stressed.</strong> After around 700 hours, I <em>still</em> get stressed (as in can&#8217;t-eat, rush-to-the-bathroom stressed) before almost every flight, especially if I have passengers.  Some time between starting the pre-flight and starting the engine, it all melts away.  I&#8217;d like to enjoy the anticipation of the flight as well as the actual flying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the <em>blog test</em> for all my flying decisions.</strong>  Would I be comfortable blogging tomorrow about my decisions and actions today, without making any excuses, modifications, or omissions?  If not, time to come up with a new plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Support and encouragement from my friends reading this will be very welcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s what it cost to own and operate a 1979 Piper Warrior II in Ottawa, Canada in 2007 with 80 hours air time (a bit more flight time, of course).  Since the US and Canadian dollars are basically at par now, there&#8217;s no need to convert:</p>
<table border="border">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are real costs, including sales taxes, not the BS costs you hear people throwing around at the airport.  Reserves are $20/hour for engine and paint.  I also pay about $500/year for charts and recurrent training, but I&#8217;d pay the same as a renter, so I don&#8217;t count those as ownership costs.</p>
<p>2007 was by far the cheapest year I&#8217;ve had with C-FBJO, and also the fewest hours I&#8217;ve flown (I&#8217;m usually over 100).  I was parked at a less expensive airport and used less gas (flying less), but the biggest difference was maintenance &mdash; annual maintenance for a small plane like mine can be $2,000 one year and $10,000 the next, depending on what goes wrong (and even the simplest plane has a lot that can go wrong).  I&#8217;m keeping a nearly 30-year-old plane operating, so stuff wears out and has to be replaced all the time, just as it would with a 30-year-old car; unlike with cars, however, buying a new plane isn&#8217;t a solution &mdash; I read recently that routine inspection and maintenance for an SR-22 runs $8,000-$10,000, and that&#8217;s <em>without</em> any problems coming up.</p>
<p>Fees include tie-down (and required club membership) at my home airport, transient landing and parking fees during trips, and the compulsory $75/year Nav Canada and $27.50 US customs fees.  Consumables are oil (mainly), filters, fluids, etc.</p>
<p>When so many of the costs &mdash; tie-down fees, insurance, and (most) maintenance &mdash; are fixed, I can  see the logic in taking one or two partners.  You&#8217;ll still pay just as much for fuel and engine/paint reserve, but you slash the other overheads.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll take a partner in C-FBJO at this point, but if I move up to something bigger like a Cherokee Six, I probably won&#8217;t try it alone.</p>
<p>So where did this money take me and my passengers (besides the Ottawa area) in 2007?  In chronological order, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYMW/">Maniwaki</a> QC, New York City (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KTEB/">Teterboro</a>), <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CA-CSC3/">Drummondville</a> QC, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYTA/">Pembroke</a> ON, Toronto ON (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYKZ/">Buttonville</a>), <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYAM/">Sault Ste. Marie</a> ON, Toronto ON (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYTZ/">City Centre</a>), <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CA-CNL3/">Brockville</a> ON, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYKF/">Waterloo</a> ON, Toronto ON (Buttonville) again, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CA-CPE6">Sundridge</a> ON, Sault Ste. Marie ON again, Toronto ON (City Centre) again, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/KBTV/">Burlington</a> VT, Boston MA (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-KOWD/">Norwood</a>), Alexandria Bay NY (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-K89N/">Maxson</a>), New Jersey and New York City (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-KCDW/">Caldwell</a>), Montreal QC (<a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYUL/">Trudeau</a>), <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYBC/">Baie Comeau</a> QC, Maniwaki QC again, and Burlington VT again.  Not all that exciting a year, but it kept the rust off the wings (mine and the plane&#8217;s).</p>

<div id="good">
<h3>The good</h3>
<p>June 17-18, 2003.  I had just finished giving a long evening seminar in the financial district in lower Manhattan, I was exhausted, and it was very late.  My original plan had been to fly home to Ottawa the next day, but bad weather was going to be arriving early in the morning and staying for the next few days, and as a VFR-only, 150-hour private pilot (my license only 9 months old), I had to fly out that night or stay the rest of the week.  I got a lift with someone out to <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/US-KCDW/">Caldwell Airport</a> in New Jersey, my eyes heavy and drooping on the drive.  I found an open gate, preflighted, and started my plane just as the control tower was closing for the night at 11:30 pm.</p>
<p>This sounds more like the beginning of an accident report than a good experience, and it&#8217;s even worse when you consider that JFK Jr. set out on his own fateful night flight from this same airport.  I had a tiny handheld non-aviation Garmin GPS with me, but it wasn&#8217;t an aviation GPS, so my primary navigation that night was VOR/DME, and the whole trip was hand-flown (I still don&#8217;t have an autopilot).  As soon as I started my engine, I was wide awake, and since I was hand-flying, I stayed that way for the whole flight &mdash; after a bit of an awkward time crawling under NY airspace, I climbed up high in a clear sky, and for the next two and a half hours I watched the lights of rural <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/NJ/">New Jersey</a>, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/PA/">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/NY/">New York</a>, and <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/CA/ON/">Ontario</a> slowly roll away under my wings.  As I approached <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYOW/">Ottawa Airport</a> at 2:00 am, there was no one else around, and tower told me just to approach the airport from any direction I wanted and pick any runway.  A woman from customs was waiting to meet me &mdash; I had to pay a call-out charge of about $40, but it was well worth it.  I&#8217;ve had a lot of wonderful flying experiences, but nothing compares to that early, dream-like night flight, that I never should have tried.</p>
</div>
<div id="bad">
<h3>The bad</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a few bad experiences actually flying, but for me, the hardest stuff has been what happens on the ground.  Even a small, private plane requires a lot of attention, to the keep the plane safe, the paperwork legal, and the costs under control, and then there&#8217;s the problem of my own recency.  If you don&#8217;t fly for a living, those stresses are in addition to your job (instead of being part of it), and they made for some bad nights and big bills early on.  After four and a half years of ownership, I now enjoy my plane and don&#8217;t have to spend nearly as much time or money on it, but I could go back in time, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d go through all that again to get to this point.</p>
</div>
<div id="weird">
<h3>The (plane) weird</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard some pretty strange things over the radio, and always enjoy the sight of my Warrior parked on a ramp beside a row of bizjets or even military fighters, but for the weird part, I&#8217;ve decided to pick something that will seem bizarre to pilots outside <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/CA/QC/">Quebec</a> and the Ottawa region: bilingual radio calls.</p>
<p>In Ottawa and Quebec, air traffic control and FSS is required to operate in French as well as English, and at uncontrolled airports, pilots will often make position reports, etc., in French.  I&#8217;ll announce in English that I&#8217;m joining the downwind, a pilot will announce in French that he&#8217;s taking the runway, someone else will do a radio check in English, the Unicom operator may attempt to give me an advisory in English and then give up (at small Quebec airports, many Unicom operators speak very little English).  Somehow or other, we avoid each-other, but it must be a terrifying experience for a unilingual English or French pilot, hearing radio calls and not knowing what they mean (especially if the caller&#8217;s voice is urgent).</p>
<p>My flight instructor was francophone but didn&#8217;t think much of the bilingual system in the air, and I agree &mdash; the air is a place that safety should trump politics.  Make all pilots learn to speak English, French, Mandarin, or whatever, but please make sure we&#8217;re all speaking the <em>same</em> language up there, whatever it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, in the cold weather, my Warrior&#8217;s battery has barely managed one try starting the plane &mdash; any more, and it goes flat.  Most recently, it happened after I&#8217;d just been flying 1.7 hours and tried to restart after a short fuel stop.  I had to figure out whether the problem was the battery or the alternator (or regulator).</p>
<div id="checklist">
<h2>Battery/alternator diagnosis checklist</h2>
<p>I phoned my AME, and he gave me a short checklist that I could run myself using only a multimeter (this is for a plane with a 14 volt electrical system and a single battery):</p>
<ul>
<li>With the engine off, a reading at the battery terminals (master off) should give at least 12.5 volts, and a reading at the cigar lighter (master on, radios off) should give at least 11.5 volts.</li>
<li>With the engine idling, a reading at the cigar lighter should give 12.5&ndash;13 volts.</li>
<li>With the engine running at 1500 rpm, a reading at the cigar lighter should give at least 13.5 volts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="analysis">
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>I left the plane tied down for extra security (in addition to the brakes), and ran the tests.  Here&#8217;s what I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engine off: 12.42 volts at the battery terminals, 11.6 volts at the cigar lighter.</li>
<li>600 rpm: fluctuating 12.7&ndash;13.1 volts</li>
<li>1000 rpm: 13.71 volts</li>
<li>1500 rpm: 13.7 volts</li>
<li>2000 rpm: 13.7 volts</li>
</ul>
<p>After running the engine for a few minutes then shutting down, the battery read 13.03 volts at the terminals, but the charge had dropped to 12.61 only 10 minutes after I shut down the plane, and would presumably keep dropping to around 12.4 again.</p>
</div>
<div id="diagnosis">
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>My alternator is obviously producing full power even at only 1000 rpm, and the regulator is kicking in to cap it at 13.7 volts.  There&#8217;s no reason that battery shouldn&#8217;t be charged; however, 12.4 volts is fairly low, and more disturbingly, after only one start attempt, the battery drops to 12 volts and can no longer turn the propeller.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m facing a bad combination of cold weather and a weak battery.  I&#8217;ve decided to replace my wet cell with a newer, high-cranking-power sealed battery, but I need to wait for a new battery box cover to arrive from Concorde; in the meantime, I&#8217;m using a loaner wet Gill battery for an upcoming New York City trip.  If you see someone carrying a dead battery into the FBO to be charged while his family waits impatiently in the plane, it&#8217;s probably me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past couple of months, I had two exceptionally good experiences with aviation-related businesses, and one exceptionally bad one.  As a service to my fellow owners, I&#8217;m going to name them all here.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Cheer: <a href="http://www.glapinc.com/">Great Lakes Aero</a></dt>
<dd>This company makes windows for light, unpressurized aircraft that are roughly triple the quality of the original manufacturers&#8217; at a third the price.  As if that weren&#8217;t enough, I bought a new windshield in May but didn&#8217;t get around to having it installed until December, when I found out that I&#8217;d bought the wrong thickness.  No problem: Great Lakes was happy to take it back and give me a refund (minus a trivial restocking fee) and ship me a new one.</dd>
<dt>Cheer: <a href="http://www.suttonaviation.com/">Sutton Aviation</a></dt>
<dd>This won&#8217;t be of much interest unless you keep your plane near Ottawa, but this year Sutton Aviation at <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Rockcliffe Airport</a> showed me that an annual inspection (and associated upgrades, rectifications, and repairs) can be fast, thorough, <em>and</em> (relatively) inexpensive.  Maybe I can afford to keep this plane after all.</dd>
<dt>Jeer: <a href="http://www.aircraftspruce.com/">Aircraft Spruce</a></dt>
<dd>I was excited when I found out that Aircraft Spruce would be opening a Canadian operation, even if it&#8217;s just a transhipment point, because I&#8217;m tired of the cross-border mail order hassles.  I called Aircraft Spruce first to confirm that their deal with UPS meant no brokerage fees (&#8220;just tax&#8221;, said the man on the phone), then discovered when my package arrived that Spruce had simply collected the infamous, non-refundable $60&ndash;70 brokerage fee on UPS&#8217;s behalf <em>before</em> shipping you the order &mdash; how is that a benefit to Canadian customers?  They refused even to apologize afterwards, much less make good on their mistake (at first, they tried to claim that the fee was sales tax, until I pointed out the sales tax on a separate line).  Until we have a real Canadian source, other mail order companies like <a href="http://www.chiefaircraft.com/">Chief Aircraft</a> will be happy for your business, and will treat you better in the bargain.</dd>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to AOPA, the <a href="http://www.aopa.org/faafundingdebate/">biggest issue facing general aviation</a> in the U.S. is the risk of user fees.  I agree with Phil Boyer that user fees could hurt GA, especially if they are per use (as in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/AU/">Australia) rather than flat fees (as in <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/CA/">Canada</a>, with <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2006/04/13/nav-canada-approves-new-service-charges/">one misguided exception</a>); however, I think that there are even bigger issues facing North American general aviation.  Here, on no scientific basis whatsoever, are my top five:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The end of AvGas:</strong> Almost nobody makes AvGas any more, it&#8217;s expensive to transport, and environmentalists rightly hate it because it&#8217;s leaded.  Watch for it to get rarer and more expensive, with more and more shortages, over the next few years, at the same time as ethanol in MoGas renders it unsuitable for the few aircraft engines that could use it.  The solution? Diesel engines, but they&#8217;re still expensive to install (nearly the whole cost of my plane), probably won&#8217;t ever be approved for all existing models, and do not yet have a significant North American maintenance network in place.  Most old planes will have to be retired, and most pilots won&#8217;t be able to afford to replace &#8217;em, so they&#8217;ll retire with their planes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(In)Security:</strong> It&#8217;s there, and it&#8217;s not going to go away.  The general public has always been afraid of airplanes (I&#8217;ve posted in the past about how <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2005/07/11/how-airshows-hurt-aviation/">we exacerbate the problem by promoting air shows</a>), and general aviation in particular scares them because it&#8217;s so lightly regulated.   In the 2004 U.S. presidential election, one of the candidates <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/2004/10/04/medicals/">was a GA pilot</a> and went out of his way not to cause problems for his fellow pilots; in 2008, we probably won&#8217;t be that lucky. And the next time something bad happens, watch for GA to be the scapegoat even more than in 2001: we could be regulated right out of existence on either or both sides of the border.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airport closures:</strong> New residential neighbourhoods, either on reclaimed industrial land in the city or former farmland in the country, almost always mean bad news for general aviation.  Airports are useful only when they&#8217;re near somewhere you want to go, so the most useful airports are typically also the most threatened: <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYTZ/">Toronto City Centre Airport</a> is constantly under seige from nearby condo dwellers, for example, and even little <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/airports/CYRO/">Rockcliffe Airport</a> struggles with community noise complaints (note that both of these airports have been there since before World War II).  Airports aren&#8217;t the only ones who suffer from the soccer-mom onslaught: in rural areas farmers have to deal with complaints from new subdivisions about noise and smell, hunters have to go further away to hunt, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Most of the GA fleet is, and will remain, old &mdash; very few of us can shell out $300K-$1M for  a new light plane, so we have to settle for spending $20K-$150K on something older.  It would take only a couple of expensive Airworthiness Directives from the FAA or Transport Canada to knock a huge part of the fleet out of the sky by requiring a repair worth more than the planes&#8217; resale value.  Furthermore, the shops that maintain these planes for us often operate on a shoestring, billing much less per hour than an auto shop, and in the <a href="http://www.ourairports.com/countries/US/">U.S.</a> a few of them are starting to <a href="http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2007/070108maintenance.html">refuse to work on older planes</a> for liability reasons (U.S. law protects manufacturers from being sued once the planes are a certain age, so the shop would be the only one to go after in a crash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User fees:</strong> We&#8217;ve been paying these in Canada for a while now, and since they&#8217;ve remained low and fixed (thanks to COPA), they don&#8217;t seem to have had any impact at all on GA.  However, that could change easily.  If either Canada or the U.S. introduced a pay-per-use system, flying could quickly become too expensive and/or too dangerous for most GA owners.  For example, if you had to pay $100 each time you filed IFR, scud running might become a bit more tempting; if you had to pay $25 for a weather briefing, you&#8217;d be less likely to talk to a specialist about icing.  Realistically, I don&#8217;t think this is as big a threat as the others, but I&#8217;m still grateful that COPA and AOPA (I&#8217;m a member of both) are looking out for our interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My plane&#8217;s back on the line today.  After doing some high-speed taxi checks to make sure nothing was leaking or running too hot or cold, I had to try to push the plane back into its spot through snow and a small ditch, cover it up, and plug it in.  Call me slow (seriously &mdash; go ahead), but it took me until my fourth winter owning a plane to figure out some very simple tricks for moving, covering, and plugging in a plane in a snowy, slippery, uneven parking spot.</p>
<div id="fulcrum">
<h3>Fulcrum</h3>
<p>It is hard to move a plane by yourself on a slippery, paved surface; it&#8217;s <em>very</em> hard to move a plane onto uneven, snow-covered dirt and grass when standing on the slippery surface; and it&#8217;s <strong>extremely</strong> difficult to do so when there&#8217;s a small ditch where both the mains will get stuck.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I learned a trick for moving the plane when all else fails: use the ends of the wings for leverage.  If you push near the wing tip (on a spar rivet line, please), you can exert a lot of force on one side and move that wheel back while the nosewheel slides sideways on the ice or dirt, pivoting around the other main.  Keep alternating sides, and eventually you can wiggle the plane back into a spot.  Unfortunately, with the wheels in a ditch, the plane was pivoting around the wrong wheel and I wasn&#8217;t able to make any progress.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> chock the wheel on the opposite side so that it doesn&#8217;t slide forward when you want the wheel on your side to slide back, guaranteeing a secure fulcrum for your pivot.  Two or three runs back and forth with the chock, and I easily had the plane back in its spot.  I&#8217;m starting to think about buying a boat winch and using it to pull the plane back by its tail tiedown.</p>
</div>
<div id="fishing">
<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>Covering a low wing plane in the winter is tricky, because as the wing gets closer to the fuselage, you actually have to slide down on your back to get the strap from the back of the wing cover and pull it through.  This gets old, fast.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> Hook the strap by reaching under the wing with a telescoping snow brush or towbar and pulling it to you (I flew <em>how</em> many winters without figuring out this one?).</p>
</div>
<div id="cable">
<h3>Cable ties</h3>
<p>As much as possible, I want to keep the extension cord I use to plug in off the ground, because as the snow thaws and refreezes, the cord can end up buried under several inches of solid ice.  I&#8217;ve tried running it over the stabilator and wing, with a couple of loops around the step for good measure, but it still ends up drooping to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> run the electrical cord <em>underneath</em> the straps for the canopy cover and wing covers, so that they act as cable ties, holding the cord tight to the fuselage.</p>
</div>
<div id="routing">
<h3>Cord routing</h3>
<p>On the 1979 Warrior, large doors open on both sides of the cowling, so that you can actually see the whole ending compartment easily during preflight (you can even change the oil, oil filter, or a vacuum pump without uncowling the plane).  The receptacle for my engine heater is behind one of those doors, but I have to leave the door unlatched to bring the plug in.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s solution:</strong> now that the electrical cord is securely strapped to the fuselage and won&#8217;t droop down, run it through the opening at the bottom of the cowling where the exhaust and oil tube are located, then pull it up to the receptacle.  Now the door can be securely latched.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been four years, almost to the day, since I bought my 1979 Piper Warrior II, and it&#8217;s time for another <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/Regserv/Affairs/cars/Part6/Standards/a625b.htm">annual inspection</a> (I&#8217;ve moved it up from May to December to avoid missing good flying weather, so this is the second annual in 2006).</p>
<p>So far, everything looks good, but this is not going to be the stereotypical owner-pilot annual inspection progress posting.  Instead, I wanted to mention that while people refer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Cherokee">Cherokee</a> as a relatively simple plane, this is the first year that it has actually <em>seemed</em> simple to me.</p>
<p>I was able to talk to my AME (mechanic) on his level instead of forcing him to stoop to mine, and I knew &#8212; not just academically, but from real experience and sense of touch &#8212; what nearly every exposed part was and how it was supposed to work.  A couple of weeks ago, I prepared a short spreadsheet of the extra work I wanted done and my estimated hours for each item, and the AME agreed that my estimates were in the right ballpark.  Today we walked through the inspection snag sheet quickly and efficiently. I approved a small amount of extra work based on the findings during the initial inspection, then drove my altimeter down to the instrument shop for its biennial recertification.</p>
<p>It really is a different experience when you understand what&#8217;s under the cowling and behind the interior panels.  Early bush pilots had to take care of their own planes, but from what I understand, a modern commercial pilot flying (say) a Cessna 182 is not even allowed to change her own oil unless she also happens to be an AME.  I&#8217;m not sure this is a good thing: maybe a month or two helping on a shop floor (fetching buckets of propwash or what-have-you) would be a good addition to the commercial pilot syllabus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m flying to Boston on Sunday for the week to chair the <a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/">XML 2006 conference</a>.  When I fly to New York City, I usually land at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teterboro_Airport">Teterboro Airport</a> and park at Atlantic Aviation &#8212; the gas is expensive, but my Cherokee doesn&#8217;t use much, and since U.S. customs is located right at Atlantic I can fly non-stop from Ottawa, shaving 45 minutes from the trip.</p>
<p>I thought about trying the same thing with Boston this time by flying into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanscom_Field">Laurence G Hanscom Field Airport</a> (aka Bedford), just west of the city. The Signature FBO is typical for a big city &#8212; expensive gas, $25 handling fee waived if you buy a minimum amount of fuel &#8212; so that&#8217;s not a problem.  MassPort, who runs the major Boston airports, also tacks on a $10 landing fee and $12.75/night parking charge, but again, that&#8217;s not too bad.</p>
<p>After that, it starts to get strange.  For example, some busy airports offer reduced landing fees at night where there&#8217;s not much traffic, but MassPort goes the other way: there&#8217;s a $49 surcharge for each landing between 11pm and 7am, and it doubles to $98 if you do it more than 5 times in a year.  I guess that&#8217;s for noise abatement.  MassPort also requires a prop lock on all parked planes, and there used to be a $10/day rental fee for them, but Signature now loans them out for free.  Finally, the kicker is a $65 user fee for the privilege of clearing customs at KBED in a four-seat plane.</p>
<p>So much for that.  I&#8217;ll add 45 minutes to my trip, clear customs for free (in Massena, NY or Burlington, VT), then land at one of the airports just outside MassPort&#8217;s ring of control and ride the commuter train in, as I&#8217;ve done three times in the past.  Check out the <a href="http://www.massport.com/hansc/hansc_operating.html">MassPort fee page</a> to see how easily bad government can take the fun out of flying &#8212; it makes the forthcoming <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2006/04/13/nav-canada-approves-new-service-charges/">Nav Canada big-airport user fees</a> look tame in comparison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December is insurance-renewal time for me.  Fortunately, this year it&#8217;s reasonably good news.</p>
<h2>How airplane insurance works</h2>
<p>There are two main components to aircraft insurance:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>liability insurance</strong>, which covers claims from people other than you (such as passengers and people on the ground); and</li>
<li><strong>hull insurance</strong>, which protects the value of your plane (some combination of in the air, on the ground in motion, on the ground not in motion, or usually all three).</li>
</ol>
<p>Liability insurance for a private plane tends to be fixed at around $500-700/year for $1,000,000 coverage, as far as I can tell.  It&#8217;s not too much, because (accident stories aside), pilots rarely hurt passengers or people on the ground. Liability insurance is <em>required</em> in Canada, even for visiting planes from the U.S.</p>
<p>Hull insurance is a percentage of the value of your plane, I think typically 1.5-3%/year, depending on the type of plane, your experience, etc., and is entirely optional &#8212; if replacing your plane wouldn&#8217;t be an extraordinarily large expense for you, then financially, you&#8217;re better off without the insurance (as with anything).  Most of the claims don&#8217;t have to do with dramatic crashes but with taxiing collisions, wind/storm damage while tied down, wheel-up landings (for retracts), ground loops and wing damage (for tail draggers), etc.  Planes are unbelievably expensive to fix, and what looks like a couple of tiny dents can sometimes result in a complete write-off.</p>
<h2>Comparing costs</h2>
<p>When comparing the cost of insuring different planes, it&#8217;s important to take hull value into account.  For example, if the hull insurance costs 2% of the hull value, then you&#8217;ll pay $1,200 hull on a plane with a declared value of $60,000, but $8,000 hull on a plane with a declared value of $400,000.  That, and not their safety record, is the main reason that new planes like the Cirrus are so expensive to insure: it costs a lot more to replace a more expensive plane (duh).</p>
<h2>The failing U.S. economy and the aircraft owner</h2>
<p>Although most Americans don&#8217;t realize it, their money has lost a huge chunk of its value over the past few years (about 30% against the Canadian dollar, and much more against the Pound and Euro), so everything priced in American dollars (including their houses, planes, boats, cars, and shares) is worth less than it used to be: a U.S. stock that was worth USD 100/share five years ago has to be priced at about USD 125/share now just to break even in Canadian terms (more in Europe), and that&#8217;s still providing $0 capital gain.  Used planes are priced primarily in US dollars, so their real value has been tumbling in recent years, even if the US sticker price looks about the same.  As a result, we Canadian airplane owners are taking a bath &#8212; the only good news is that since our planes are worth so much less, they&#8217;re cheaper to insure (it&#8217;s also cheap to buy up, if you&#8217;re so inclined).</p>
<h2>This year&#8217;s damage</h2>
<p>My insurance cost has been declining gradually since I bought the plane due to my increasing experience and ratings, but the fall in the U.S. dollar (and subsequent drop in my plane&#8217;s resale value) has accelerated things.  This year, I&#8217;ll be paying only CAD 1,520 to insure my Warrior for hull and liability, down from about CAD 2,300 when I bought the plane in 2002 &#8212; the drop in the plane&#8217;s value due to the low U.S. dollar accounts for $200-300 of that, and some of the rest might come from my having passed the magic 500 hour mark last year.  Now I have to keep my fingers crossed for a cheap annual inspection as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> The ELT is back and recertified with a new battery, but the forecast tomorrow calls for cloud and ice from about hilltop level to 9,000 ft, so the Hope Air flight is canceled.</em></p>
<p>UNSAR is the Transport Canada acronym for an <cite>UnNecessary Search And Rescue</cite> alert.  In addition to publicising the problem in <a href="http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/SystemSafety/Newsletters/tp185/1-03/436.htm">a newsletter article</a>, they have produced a poster that&#8217;s shown in most FBOs and flying clubs with rescue aircraft circling a delivery van, a (perfectly OK) float plane, etc., while in the bottom right panel a real crash goes unattended.</p>
<p>I was on my way home from a family breakfast Sunday morning when I noticed a message on my cell phone.  The SAR centre picked up an ELT signal from the vicinity of Rockcliffe Airport, and after a line check, they determined that it was coming from my plane.  I was out there within 45 minutes, and determined that</p>
<ol>
<li>The signal <em>was</em> coming from my plane (strong enough that it spilled over onto other frequencies).</li>
<li>The cockpit ELT switch was set to &#8220;arm&#8221;, not &#8220;on&#8221;.</li>
<li>Turning the switch to &#8220;off&#8221; stopped the ELT for a minute or so, then it started again.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would have been better, of course, if I&#8217;d been in the habit of turning the cockpit switch to &#8220;off&#8221; whenever I parked the plane, but in this case, it wouldn&#8217;t have helped &#8212; after a couple of weeks of constant rain, my guess is that some moisture got into the side panels and shorted the switch, since the ELT was intermittently activating with the switch in any position.  With freezing, fumbling fingers, I grabbed a Phillips screwdriver (<em>always</em> keep a multi-head screwdriver in your plane), opened the access panel in the tailcone, shoved my hands through the tiny, sharp-edged access hole (we don&#8217;t pay mechanics enough), turned the main switch on the ELT unit from &#8220;arm&#8221; to &#8220;off&#8221;, disconnected the antenna and wires, and figured out how to remove the unit.</p>
<p>Just as I was finishing, a SAR person walked up to the airplane to talk to me. He was very friendly and reassuring about the whole thing as he copied down the details from my ELT box (recertified May 2006) and confirmed the time that I shut down the unit, so that the SAR centre could close the file on the activation.  I also learned a couple of interesting tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of an UNSAR, standard procedure (if the owner or pilot couldn&#8217;t be located fast) used to be to get access to the plane as fast as possible causing as little damage as possible, but after complaints, SOP is now simply to wait for the battery to die.</li>
<li>Further to the first point, the equipment used by the SAR satellite monitoring centre is now good enough to distinguish the idiosyncracies of the crystal used in each specific radio, so that one ELT signal won&#8217;t prevent them from distinguishing another one (though it must make it no fun for airliners, and FSS and ATC units that have to monitor 121.5 continuously).</li>
</ul>
<p>It also turns out that this weekend there was a survival training camp at Rockcliffe hosted by the SAR people, so my UNSAR gave them a chance to practice homing in on a real ELT signal on 121.5 (usually they have to use separate training frequencies).  While I&#8217;m very sorry for all the hassle caused to so many people, I&#8217;m glad that some tiny good came out of it.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m taking my ELT unit into the avionics shop to have it reinspected (I expect that it&#8217;s fine) and to have the battery tested, since I don&#8217;t know how much it drained during the activation.  After that, I&#8217;ll reinstall it in the plane, but won&#8217;t reconnect the cockpit switch until I can have it inspected as well (I&#8217;ll placard that the script is U/S and will write a snag in my Journey Log to cover the legal bases).  I&#8217;m also going to remove the pilot-side panels to see if there is water getting in there somehow.</p>
<p>I could legally fly the plane for 30 days without an ELT as long as I put a placard in the panel, but I have a Hope Air flight coming up across hundreds of miles of nothing (the kind of area where every building is shown on the map, and there&#8217;s enough room for a small U.S. state in-between them).  The ELT activation was an accident, but flying across wilderness in winter weather with no ELT would be just stupid.</p>
<p>So, for those of you considering becoming aircraft owners, are you still interested?  Even with a simple plane like a Cherokee or 172, you can expect 2-to-5 unexpected minor crises like this every year, though most don&#8217;t involve anyone but you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I moved from Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier International to Ottawa/Rockcliffe at the beginning of this month, I&#8217;ve had a chance to take only two flights, but with two drastically-different results.</p>
<div>
<h2>Night &#8230;</h2>
<p>One fine evening I decided to drive to the airport and fly some night circuits to stay night-current. I usually love night circuits: the air is still, the visibility is excellent, the frequencies are quiet, and it&#8217;s very easy to spot traffic.  This time, though, nothing went right.  The area where my plane is parked is extremely dark, and the path through the parked planes is entirely unlit.  To make things worse, the dome and map lights in my plane weren&#8217;t working.  I ran through my checklist using a flashlight, started the plane, taxied gingerly to the runway in the dark (trying not to knock off anyone&#8217;s spinner with my wing tips), took off, and then realized that I hadn&#8217;t set my altimeter.</p>
<p>At my previous home airport, I always set the altimeter when I listed to the ATIS, but of course, there was no ATIS at Rockcliffe.  I&#8217;ve flown from many other untowered airports without forgetting to set my altimeter to field elevation, but because I thought of Rockcliffe as my <em>home</em> airport now, I was following my old home procedures.  I had last flown in fairly low pressure, so the altimeter was so far off that it was effectively useless, and without the overhead map light I was forced to use a flashlight to see the tachometer.  I could have radioed Gatineau for their altimeter setting, but that would have meant digging out the CFS to get the frequency and then reading with the flashlight, when I already had enough on my hands.  I just flew my best estimate of circuit altitude, glanced at the altimeter to see how many hundred feet it was off when the wheels touched on my first circuit, then adjusted it when I was safely back in the downwind.  After a couple of circuits, my setting was fairly accurate.</p>
<p>The second challenge is the runway lighting.  Rockcliffe has no VASIS or PAPI approach-slope lighting, so you&#8217;re entirely on your own, and to make matters worse, only 1.700 ft of the 3,300 ft runway is lighted for night operations.  Normally, landing and taking off on a 1,700 ft runway in a Cherokee or Skyhawk is no big deal, but at night, with no approach-slope lighting and trees hiding somewhere under me in the dark, it required some fine-tuned flying &#8212; more importantly, I tried to imagine coming home at night after a family trip in MVFR and landing, and it didn&#8217;t seem like a fun prospect.</p>
<p>By the end of the evening, I&#8217;d decided that I&#8217;d move the plane back to Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier as soon as my three-month committment was over, extra cost be damned.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>&#8230; and Day</h2>
<p>Before my next flight, I drove to the airport, opened the lighting dome, reattached a loose ground wire, and restored cockpit lighting (I also put on my canopy cover, to help keep the plane dry in all this rain.  Then, in nice VFR weather, I went to the airport last Sunday morning and just flew: no flight plan, no talking to ATC (but a lot of attention to airspace), but just a little tour over the Gatineaus and around within the 25 nm no-flight-plan circle.</p>
<p>I actually like talking to ATC &#8212; I learned to fly at a busy airport, and feel no stress around it &#8212; but it was a surprisingly relaxing experience flying around entirely on my own, without a fixed plan.  After an hour of slow, low-altitude (I do most of my flying cross-country at 5,000-10,000 ft) flying around hills, lakes, and rivers, circling small towns and a covered bridge, and admiring the fall leaves, I came back in along the Cumberland-Rockcliffe VFR corridor, crossed for the midfield downwind, and landed.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that the people at Rockcliffe don&#8217;t seem particularly friendly compared to people at other small airports I&#8217;ve visited: almost without exception, people on the porch or in the parking lot glance away awkwardly if I smile, nod, or wave, instead of waving back. The people in the clubhouse are mostly tired and/or tense flight instructors, though the dispatch and line staff were friendly enough.  I guess you can&#8217;t have everything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still deciding what to do in January, but I might give Rockcliffe a full year so that I can see all its different faces.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, under a low ceiling and poor visibility in showers, I made my shortest-ever point-to-point trip in an airplane, flying the 7 nm from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Macdonald-Cartier_International_Airport">Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier</a> to my plane&#8217;s <a href="/blogs/lahso/2006/09/08/moving-to-a-new-airport/">new home</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa/Rockcliffe_Airport">Ottawa/Rockcliffe</a>.</p>
<p>There are dozens, if not hundreds of light aircraft based at Rockcliffe, of all descriptions: the largest is a shorter-bodied version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-31_Navajo">Piper Navajo</a>, and the smallest are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_J-3">Cub-sized</a> two-seaters and similar. There are many vintage and unusual aircraft tied down along the long rows of the flightline.</p>
<p>While one of the Rockcliffe instructors and I were standing in the rain kicking, raking, and digging through the mud trying to find the long-disused tie-down chains in my new spot, he mentioned that he thought my plane was the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Cherokee">Warrior</a> on the field (though there are many other Cherokees).  Who&#8217;d have figured that a Warrior, of all planes, would stand out on a flightline?  I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t fly anything more mundane, like, say, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERCO_Ercoupe">Ercoupe</a> &#8212; I&#8217;d hate to blend into the crowd.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note to American readers:</strong> while the Warrior is a very common training plane in the U.S., it&#8217;s not very popular in Canada &#8212; until the mid 1990s, spin training was required for a Canadian PPL, and unlike the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172">Cessna 172</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_150">150</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_152">152</a>, Warriors are not certified for intentional spins.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a lot of agonizing, I&#8217;ve decided to move my Warrior from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Macdonald-Cartier_International_Airport">Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier</a> (CYOW) eight nautical miles northeast to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa/Rockcliffe_Airport">Ottawa/Rockcliffe</a> (CYRO) effective 1 October.  The short flight means a huge number of changes for me: I&#8217;ll be leaving Canada&#8217;s 6th busiest airport, where you have to tune in three different frequencies (ATIS, Clearance delivery, and ground) before you even start taxiing, and moving to an uncontrolled airport in the middle of parkland by the Ottawa River.  Here&#8217;s a shot of part of the flight line, taken from the clubhouse porch:</p>
<p><img alt="Flight line at CYRO" src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/cyro-flight-line.jpg?w=640" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve flown into, maybe, 30 or 40 different airports, from tiny grass strips to huge international airports much busier than CYOW, but coming home from a long trip I&#8217;ve always know that there was a lot of support waiting for me, including two ILS approaches, several FBOs, heated hangars for deicing, emergency equipment, all types of servicing, washrooms available 24/7 for desperate passengers, etc.  Now, I&#8217;m going to be arriving at an airport with no instrument approach, one tiny maintenance shop on the field, and a barbeque that never seems to stop churning out hamburgers (little use to a vegetarian like me, sadly). It&#8217;s going to be a big adjustment.  One nice feature is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Aviation_Museum">Canada Aviation Museum</a> on the south side of the field, across the runway from the tie-downs:</p>
<p><img src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/cam.jpg?w=640" alt="Canada Aviation Museum" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never kept my plane anywhere but the big airport. I did my primary flight training, night rating, and instrument rating there, and when I bought my Warrior, the broker flew it in from Toronto and we did the preflight there.  I have no regrets about training at a busy airport &#8212; I know too many pilots who are terrified of ATC and busy airspace, but I&#8217;ve flown around Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia (as well as many smaller airports) with no problem at all, because I was used to the radio work right from the start.  When I was first asking about flying lessons, flight schools at small airports gave me a lot of BS about higher training costs or long delays at towered airports, but they didn&#8217;t turn out to be a problem, and I feel like I would have had only a partial education learning to fly somewhere like Rockcliffe.</p>
<p>Now, though, the expense is catching up with me.  I have a very good deal on a tie-down spot with plug-in at the big airport, but when I add up landing fees and other costs, I calculated that it&#8217;s costing me about $1,000/year more to park at Macdonald-Cartier than it will at Rockcliffe (they&#8217;re the same distance from my house), even when I factor in two diversions/year for weather and the resulting cab fares and parking expenses.  Next year, when Nav Canada brings in their <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/tiedown-spot.jpgarchives/2006/04/13/nav-canada-approves-new-service-charges/">new user fees</a> for large airports, I calculate that the price difference will jump to $1,500/year.  I won&#8217;t speculate about how hard a commercial pilot like <a href="http://airplanepilot.blogspot.com/">Aviatrix</a> or <a href="http://sulako.blogspot.com/">Sulako</a> has to work to make that much, but it&#8217;s a lot for me, too, especially with two daughters hitting university in the next decade.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my new tie-down spot. It doesn&#8217;t look like much, but presumably, there are tie-downs and some paving stones under all that grass and weed:</p>
<p><img src="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/tiedown-spot.jpg?w=640" alt="New tie-down spot." /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a matter of money &#8212; I&#8217;m hoping that a new airport will give me a new start with flying, maybe bringing me closer to other pilots and to my plane itself.  Rockcliffe seems like a much more pleasant place to spend a sunny afternoon waxing the plane or BSing with other pilots in the clubhouse (or mowing my parking spot), even if I can&#8217;t eat the burgers.</p>

<p>I spent a bit over an hour today flying a spanking-new Cirrus SR22-GTS, courtesy of <a href="http://www.easyairshare.com/">Easy Air Share</a>, which is setting up a fractional ownership program here in Ottawa. I flew in the left seat with Floyd, a production test pilot from Cirrus, in the right seat. Here, as a counterpoint to <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/sr22-panel.jpgarchives/2005/12/03/cirrus-owners-review-mixed/">a previous Cirrus posting</a>, are some of my initial impressions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Best feature:</dt>
<dd>electric elevator and aileron trim &#8212; I used it religiously to relieve control pressures.</dd>
<dt>Second best feature:</dt>
<dd>pilot-side door.</dd>
<dt>Most overrated feature:</dt>
<dd>the glass panel (it&#8217;s cool, but it&#8217;s more information than I really want when I&#8217;m flying, especially VFR).</dd>
<dt>Hand flying:</dt>
<dd>slightly more slippery than a Warrior, but after a bit of practice, it was no problem holding heading and altitude &#8212; the stuff people say about needing the AP to fly is BS.</dd>
<dt>Instrumentation:</dt>
<dd>I missed the <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/sr22-panel.jpgarchives/2005/05/19/analog-flying/">analog</a> altimeter and gyro compass (there was a backup altimeter at the bottom), but I got used to the tape display fast enough.</dd>
<dt>Landing characteristics:</dt>
<dd>slightly higher approach speed, but otherwise almost identical to landing a Cherokee or 172.</dd>
<dt>Power:</dt>
<dd>I&#8217;d like to be able to choose my own RPM on the CS propeller; the engine flew nice and smooth <a href="https://lahso.megginson.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/sr22-panel.jpgarchives/2004/12/23/leaning/">lean of peak</a>, though.</dd>
<dt>Castering nosewheel:</dt>
<dd>no big deal, no big problem.</dd>
<dt>Sidestick:</dt>
<dd>no big deal, no big problem, except that it requires very small inputs compared to a Cherokee or 172.</dd>
<dt>Leg room in the back seat:</dt>
<dd>(tested on the ground) very spacious. </dd>
<dt>Autopilot:</dt>
<dd>smooth and well integrated.</dd>
<dt>Four-point harness:</dt>
<dd>extremely comfortable.</dd>
<dt>Sound system:</dt>
<dd>nice, but not a big deal for me.</dd>
<dt>Chute:</dt>
<dd>no opportunity to observe.</dd>
<p>Would I mind owning a share of an SR22? Not at all. It feels like a great machine for long cross-country trips, and I know my family would love every second in it. But I couldn&#8217;t help thinking how much more fun that same flight would have been in my trusty old Warrior, slow speed, and all. I love working on computers; I don&#8217;t know if I love <em>flying</em> them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Niss, who flies out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNA3">Barrie Airpark</a> (CNA3), left this comment on my posting <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/lahso/archives/2006/01/02/should-i-buy-or-rent">Should I buy or rent?</a> (divide all prices by about 1.2 to get US dollars):</p>
<blockquote><p>I am looking to buy a share in an aircraft. Right now at my local airport (CNA3) there is a 1966 Piper Cherokee 140 on the ramp. The owner is looking for $32500 and I am told that he might be interested in selling off 25% Shares. TTSN: 5693 HRs SMOH: 1917 HRs, cylinders were redone 400 hours ago. The broker that is selling it is my old boss and mentor at the airport, so I know the salesman and the owner are reputable. Also I am a student, am looking to go on to bigger and better things including my CPL and other rateings. What do you guys think this animal would cost in maintenace fees, etc? Would you say this is a wise decision for a student?</p></blockquote>
<p>Niss &#8211; that sounds like a reasonable starter aircraft for VFR. If you want to go on and get your instrument rating, you should know that the panel is probably not in the standard T arrangement, unless someone has had it redone; you might also need to make some changes to the panel and add an alternate static air source if the plane is not currently IFR-ready. Neither of these should be a deal killer, but it&#8217;s good to be aware. Go for a test flight in the plane (you should pay for the gas, and the owner or broker should be with you) and see how you like it.</p>
<p>Before you plunk down about CAD 10K (including tax) for a 25% share, you need to have a thorough prepurchase inspection done by a mechanic who has <em>never</em> worked on the plane &#8212; that might mean bringing someone in for the day from Brampton, Markham, Peterborough, or another city nearby. Expect to spend at least CAD 1K on the inspection, maybe more if there are any areas of concern. Obviously, it would be nice to get all the 25% partners together first so that you have to do the inspection only once and can split the cost &#8212; otherwise, each will have to do his or her own inspection. A proper prepurchase will take a full day and involve a detailed review of the logbooks (including airworthiness directives and service bulletins), removing the cowling and all inspection plates, checking compressions, looking for corrosion inside the wings, etc. The plane will probably be put up on jacks, and if there are any concerns, the seats might come out as well to allow better access to the interior. You should also review the logbooks yourself to see how often the plane has flown (if it flies less than 100 hours a year, look at it carefully; if it flies less than 50, be concerned; if it flies less than 25, be *very* concerned), whether there is any damage history, and how often parts are replaced. When&#8217;s the last time the vacuum pump was replaced, for example? How old is the battery? How old are the tires? Are the gyros getting elderly? This might be too much to worry about for your first plane, but you can bet I&#8217;ll be checking if or when I buy my second &#8212; even if the individual parts are relatively inexpensive, it gives you a good idea of how well the plane has been maintained.</p>
<p>Remember that the time on the engine has a lot to do with the value of the plane. Including removal, shipping, and reinstallation, an engine overhaul for a Lycoming O-320 costs at least CAD 25K, maybe more like CAD 30K. Is the engine on this plane just about run out (2000 hours)? Has the engine been giving trouble and getting a lot of top work (new cylinders)? Are the compressions OK? The mechanic can help with that. Many people believe that a half-time engine (~1,000 hours) is the best deal &#8212; a brand-new overhaul done just to sell the plane might be shoddy, while a run-out engine will require you to take the time to do the overhaul and break in a new engine. Likewise, beware of any plane sold with a fresh annual &#8212; that has no value to you, since the seller will probably defer any marginal items.</p>
<p>Expect all the partners combined to spend about CAD 5K/year on maintenance, excluding engine reserve, if the plane is in good condition &#8212; that includes replacing radios, pumps, tires, batteries, starters, etc. as they fail. The plane will also need to be painted every decade or two, at a cost of over CAD 10K Some AMEs will let you help with the maintenance, reducing the cost a bit, but whether that&#8217;s a reasonable trade will depend on how much your time is worth. The problem is that there&#8217;s a lot of variability &#8212; you might pay $2,000 one year, and $8,000 the next. You&#8217;ll spend about $2,000/year on insurance, given the low airframe value, and gas and oil will depend on your flying (estimate about CAD 35/hour for gas, depending on where you buy it). Parking will depend on where you decide to keep the plane &#8212; you&#8217;ll want at least an electrical plugin if you plan to fly in the winter. A hangar can be expensive, but also much more convenient (and you can split it four ways).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first questions that occurs to new pilots is this: <em>buy or rent</em>? A lot of people write about this question online and in print, and they mostly try to help you make the decision by opening a spreadsheet to figure out the cost of owning and operating a plane, dividing the cost by the number of hours you&#8217;re likely to fly, and then comparing that with rental rates. I took that approach before buying my Warrior.</p>
<p>That approach is completely useless.</p>
<h2>When renting doesn&#8217;t work</h2>
<p>I spent a few months as a renter after my plane was hit by lightning, and the experience reminded me why I don&#8217;t rent. Unless you&#8217;re willing to book weeks or (more likely) months in advance, you&#8217;re not going to be allowed to take a rental airplane away for a whole weekend, much less a whole week. If you <em>are</em> allowed to take a rental plane for that long, and the weather cooperates (remember that you cannot leave a day earlier or come back a day later), you&#8217;re usually going to have to pay a minimum fee &#8212; say, 3 hours/day &#8212; whether the plane flies or not.</p>
<p>That money adds up fast. If I rented a Cessna 172 for CAD 120/hour dry to fly from Ottawa to PEI for a week in the summer (about eight hours&#8217; flying round-trip), my cost before fuel and taxes would be not CAD 960 for eight hours, but CAD 2,520 for 21 hours, even though the plane was tied down for most of that. Add about $300 for fuel, and you&#8217;re well over CAD 3,000 total for the trip. Of course, the odds of getting a 172 for a full week in the summer are so small that this is mostly hypothetical.</p>
<h2>When renting does work</h2>
<p>On the other hand, rental planes are almost always available for two or three hours, even on the weekend. If you want to just fly around the area to take friends up for sightseeing, or work on a rating, or fly with a buddy for a quick lunch at a nearby airport, renting works great, and you&#8217;ll save a lot of money over owning.</p>
<p>If one rental plane is down for maintenance, you can just take another one. If the plane makes a funny noise during runup, you can just taxi it back to the hangar and hand the problem over to someone else. If all you want to do is fly a plane the way your friends use their boats, a few hours at a time on nice weekends, then renting is a very low-stress solution.</p>
<h2>Making the decision</h2>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re a new pilot trying to decide whether to buy or rent, ask yourself this: do you want to do nothing but fly around the area on Saturday afternoons, or do you want to go places on overnight trips? If you want to do <em>any</em> non-trivial amount of travelling, even just a couple of family or business trips every year, you can put away your spreadsheet, because owning &#8212; either alone, in a partnership, or as part of a fractional ownership program &#8212; is really your only choice.</p>
<p>Owning is often expensive, but it does not have to be, especially if (unlike me) you&#8217;re willing to share a simple, slow plane with a few partners: 25% of a Cherokee 140 in a 4-way partnership will cost you as little as CAD 10,000 up front (which you&#8217;ll get back &#8212; less sales tax &#8212; when you sell), maybe CAD 2-3,000/year in fixed costs, plus fuel and engine reserve for each hour you fly. It will also, of course, cost you the headaches of ownership, including arranging maintenance, paying unexpected costs, changing oil, cleaning bugs, waxing wings, shovelling snow, finding alternatives when the plane is down for a few months for painting or engine overhaul, taking time off work to go to the shop, etc.</p>
<h2>Airplanes aren&#8217;t like cars</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad that renting planes cannot be more like renting cars. Our family gets by with only one vehicle &#8212; we live near downtown, and when there&#8217;s a conflict and one of us cannot walk or take transit, we use VRTUcar (an extremely inexpensive shared car program &#8212; there are two parked a couple of blocks from my house) for in-town travelling, or we rent a car for out-of-town trips. The money we save from not owning a second car covers a huge part of the cost of owning our plane. Go figure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in July 2005 (updated in September), Philip Greenspun published a <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/cirrus-sr20">detailed owner&#8217;s review</a> of his factory-new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_SR20">Cirrus SR20</a>, the 200 hp (cheaper) sibling of the Cirrus SR22. Philip has flown his plane pretty seriously around a huge part of the continent (including the Canadian arctic), and has a long list of both the good and bad aspects of it. There are dozens of annoyances &#8212; large and small &#8212; that you&#8217;d never know about after reading a glossy magazine review written on the basis of a single test flight.</p>
<p>Philip also speculates about the actual safety value of the chute. In his opinion, most or all of the cases where people have pulled the chute and survived would have been survivable in a non-chute equipped Piper or Cessna, while in the cases where the chute really <em>was</em> necessary, it failed and resulted in a fatal accident. I don&#8217;t know how accurate this analysis is, but it&#8217;s an interesting perspective, especially coming from a Cirrus owner.</p>
<p>This page is highly-recommended reading, even if (like me) you cannot imagine ever being able to afford a factory-new plane. The 6-8 week, USD 10,000/year annuals &#8212; <strong>while still under warranty</strong> &#8212; are certainly an eye-opener. I wonder how much he&#8217;ll pay for maintenance when the plane is a little older and the warranty has expired. It sounds like a pretty nice plane, though, on balance, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t turn one down.</p>
