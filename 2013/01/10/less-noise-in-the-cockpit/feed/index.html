					<description><![CDATA[David:

I have a similar memory.  In my 35+-year-ago life, when I lived in Toronto, a friend and I flew her C-182 to Churchill.  On the way back, we caught up to a cold front at S S Marie and a full day later we were stuck at Gore Bay - Manitoulin Island, waiting for the weather to clear.  Finally, the next day we set off again for home.  We climbed high for the water crossing from South Baymouth to Tobermory.  The sun had not yet burned the fog off the Lake and below us the Chi-Cheemaun ferry had begun its southward crossing.  The sun was shining brightly and sparkling off the wake.  But, to my surprise, the ferry also made a wake in the fog.  I had never had that vantage point before and was enthrawled!

I have a Hunter 27 on Lake of the Woods, just east of Kenora.  Want to come for a sail?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, John.  I flew from Ottawa to Winnipeg a couple of summers ago, and very much enjoyed the city (and the flight).  The highlight was starting my return flight out of YWG before dawn, then watching the sun rise over Lake of the Woods on my way home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David:  I am enjoying your posts very much and have just returned to flying after 30 years off to raise the kids.  I have gained so much confidence from my Aera 500 yolk mount.  The difference from 30 years ago when I had to struggle to know where I was at all times just from map reading is easy to get used to.  Just a couple of weeks ago I did my first solo cross country in recent memory and was approaching a small airport on the Winnipeg River (Lac Du Bonnet CYAX).  it is a single paved strip hidden by trees and I was approaching the N-S runway from the west.  I confidently did all my calls at 10 miles, 5 miles, 2 miles but never saw the field until 1/2 mile.  But I KNEW it was there and I was right on my navigation - a monkey could fly with a good GPS.
Thank you especially for your explanation of the cost of owning.  I would love to own or share a Warrior and always have at least three up in my browser to drool and dream over.  Alas, I also need to retire, then whence the funds?? BBC? My kind of fellow.  When you come to Winnipeg, you have a place to stay.  (I met a German felllow in Puerto Rico who calls it &#039;couch surfing&#039;.  I&#039;d never heard that term before.)]]></description>
