					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Looks like I&#039;m late to this discussion having just discovered OurAirports. I&#039;m a volunteer on the free open-source Avare moving map Android app. My daughter &#038; family live in Edmonton, and I&#039;ve been trying to get *any* sort of Canadian maps &#038; airport data to use in Avare. Zubair, the developer of Avare, is about to alpha test Canadian topo charts for Avare and we may also use OurAirports data. If you&#039;d like to help, or get in contact with us, please use the link in the Google Play Store for the Avare app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ds.avare]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you all for your feedback.

&lt;b&gt;Dave:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, I did think of the &quot;I might get sued&quot; problem, but it&#039;s there already — someone could claim that a loved one typed some (incorrect, user-contributed) coordinates into a GPS and then flew into a mountain.  Agreed about disclaimers.

&lt;b&gt;Paul:&lt;/b&gt; There are a lot of good flight planning sites out there already.  I&#039;m not ruling it out completely, but I think OurAirports could play a better role as an honest open-data broker for all of them.

&lt;b&gt;Blake:&lt;/b&gt; right now, the member airport map accounts for only 0.17% of page views.  The people who use the feature love it, but it&#039;s not a significant part of the site&#039;s traffic.  These are the most-common destinations:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport airline arrivals and departures: 45%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport map (and most-recent comments): 13%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airport pilot info (weather, NOTAMs, frequencies, etc.): 9%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List of airports in a state or province: 7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local search results: 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other airports close to an airport: 4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home page: 3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

After that, it breaks into a very long tail.  The fact that arrivals and departures account for so much makes me nervous, because it&#039;s not original value added by OurAirports; it&#039;s just a couple of iFrames embedded (as allowed) from FlightStats, and a third-party service can disappear at any time (as many Twitter client apps discovered).

Because of that vulnerability, I&#039;d like to refocus OurAirports on the areas where it really can add original value — my posting was wondering out loud if &lt;i&gt;interpretive&lt;/i&gt; weather info could be one of those areas (with 68,000 pageviews a month already for the ugly, messy pilot-info page, there&#039;s clearly some demand)]]></description>

I agree with Pat. I don&#039;t really think users of OA would even benefit from such a service (weather, etc..)

Personally, I use OA to keep track of which airports I&#039;ve been to and to leave comments about airports. That&#039;s it. Sure, I may not be the &quot;typical&quot; OA user, but I would argue that is what the majority of users of the site do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The responsive design would be great and could benefit all users of openairplane. 

As for the weather/flight planning I think that sounds like self imposed feature creep. There are already so many great tools out there on the internet/devices. First make OA the best platform for renting and airplane out there. Add the candy and shiny things later.

Keep up the great work btw! I am looking forward to getting checked out sometime soon.]]></description>

If you ask the users, there will need to be features for the most prolific commenters:
- the &quot;when the hell&quot; guy
- the pet scam victims in Douala
- the Philippines immigration people.]]></description>
