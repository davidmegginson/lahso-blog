					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s one huge csv.  I&#039;ve Wouldn&#039;t it be easier to divide the locations up into separate files divide by continent and load them like modules?  I&#039;ve only programmed for about 5 years, but I&#039;ve learned whenever you need to work with that much information, it&#039;s better to divide it up into smaller data.  It saves loading time (provided someone&#039;s not trying fly to all continents at the same time), and much easier to maintain.

I&#039;ve read your post about the airports that have no country or are in between countries, but as a workaround you could also have a extra &quot;special-airports&quot; file that could be loaded before everything else.]]></description>
