					<description><![CDATA[Relating to no. 1 as well:  IF a description of my flight decisions or actions begins to sound like the opening remarks in an accident investigation report, I know it is time to slow down and take a close double-look at what I am doing.

(I.e. The pilot pressed on into deteriorating conditions... or the pilot neglected to top up his fuel tanks during an enroute stop as he was in a hurry to arrive at his destination... etc..)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello David!  It sounds to me like you hit the best 5 items possible to want to brush up with!  I also like that you made them specific and realistic goals.  Shows that you have yourself grounded even when you think of flying.  Reminds me of someone else I know who can&#039;t seem to get off the ground for love or money!

If you are looking for someone to share in your pre flight anxiousness, I&#039;m the guy looking kinda restless on the ramp..  ;)

All the best for 2009!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Intersting thoughts.  In particular I very much like number 1.  If a pilot thinks of writing down every step of his/her preparation and then decison making for a flight as if they would be eagerly read by others, it is likely a lot of accident reports would bever be written.

years ago a favorite instructor imparted a somewaht similar thought ... in particular he was trying to prepare me for one of the well-know risk plateaus in a young pilot&#039;s career ... the 200-hour or so private pilot &#039;zone&#039;.

His advice?  Plan and conduct the flight as if your mom was a passeneger and you were explaing each decison, during planning and during the flight to her.  It&#039;s the kind of advice that can never hurt, won&#039;t cost a thing, and might very well &#039;save the bacon&#039; some day.

All the best in 2009 and beyond.]]></description>
