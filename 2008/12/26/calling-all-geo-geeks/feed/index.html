					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Ross and Ed.  I found that Wikipedia has already answered my question in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_spanning_more_than_one_continent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;excruciating detail&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#039;s a mess &#8212; not only do many countries and even subdivisions overlap continents, but there&#039;s not always full agreement on what continents some areas belong to.

The enclaves and other foreign territories aren&#039;t always a problem, because many of them have their own ISO 3166 codes, so OurAirports treats them as separate countries.  Here are some examples:


&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/countries/FK/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/countries/PM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;St. Pierre and Miquelon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/countries/IO/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;British Indian Ocean Territory&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/countries/GL/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/countries/UM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;U.S. Minor Outlying Islands&lt;/a&gt;


Melilla and the Canary Islands don&#039;t have a separate code from Spain, however, so those need to be dealt with.  When a country has a military base on another country&#039;s territory (hostile or otherwise), I assign the base to the host country, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/airports/MUGM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Leeward Point Field&lt;/a&gt; at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station is assigned to Cuba, even though the U.S. controls the field, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourairports.com/airports/LCRA/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RAF Akrotiri&lt;/a&gt; is assigned to Cyprus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about exclaves and dependent territories? Britain has dependent islands all over the shop, including Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands which sports a UK ICAO code (EGYP) and has a small scheduled service. Spain has two cities in North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla), the latter of which has an airport (though its ICAO code, GEML, is correct for NW Africa). Don&#039;t forget NZSP, either ;)]]></description>
