					<description><![CDATA[Quite interesting, especially how small the world seems to be.  I drove past Plaridel and Clark the same day you posted.  I&#039;ve never visited Plaridel on the ground or from the air, even though it&#039;s the closest airport to my home ... I must make time to drive there some afternoon ... gosh this retirement ahs no free time, what a poor planner am I.

Plaridel (RPUX)is quite busy with training, on my regular trips laong the expresweway that passes close I always see quite afew Cessna&#039;s in the pattern, usually 172&#039;s.  They did, sadly, have a midair in the pattern just a few months ago.

Clark (RPLC) has a very busy FBO (Omni Aviation) with their own runway separate from the military/airline side of the field.  I notice they are now packed to the gills, running out of tiedown spaces,their aircraft population must have tripled in the year and a half I&#039;ve been observing them.

Rental costs here in the Philippines are in the same range as the US and Canada, costs for instructor pilots is understandably lower as are most wages here.  For those US pilots who haven&#039;t been actively supporting the AOPS and fighting FAA user fees, consider this .. to file IFR you get charged $9 dollars an hour, from clearance delivery to flight plan closeout ... more thna the instructor pilot makes.  Don&#039;t let this happen to you.

Interesting, though, when I read all the comments from pilots from North America re the difficulty of finding  a flying job ... they certainly haven&#039;t looked at Asia and Europe ... the Philippine senate is currently embroiled in debate over a bill that will require Filipino pilot trainees to stay in country because they leave immediately upon earning their tickets and Philippine airlines are growing and need pilots ... many go to China, in particular, where airlines are growing by leaps and bounds and generla aviation is just starting.

And roger that on the reduction in the US dollar, I&#039;ve lost 25% of my income in terms of the dollar versus the lowly Philippine Peso, and there is little sign of the dollar regaining strength.  Many companies who cater a lot to foreigners here, such as flight schools, used to quote all their prices in US dollars ... boy has that changed in the past year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David,

A big of digging suggests that the Raven RX6 is a hot air balloon.  Example here:
