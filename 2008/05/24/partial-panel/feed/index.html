					<description><![CDATA[I lost an electric AI in almost the exact same way you did, in an Arrow, in IMC...and then lost the turn coordinator several minutes later. At the time I thought electrical emergency, but didn&#039;t lose anything else and it turned out to be a crazy coincidence. Losing the AI and TC together was enough...holding the wings level by reference to heading indicator alone wasn&#039;t very fun. Fortunately only had to do it for about 10 minutes until I was over lower terrain &#038; could get a descent below cloud bases.

Good job with the partial panel. It&#039;s something most people don&#039;t practice enough once they get the IR.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t it nice how much easier partial panel is when you actually have a heading indicator too? That goes a long way to keeping control of the airplane when you lose the main focus of your scan (the AI). Nice work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good to hear you got it down in proper order David!  Have to love those long runways back at your old stomping grounds.  I spent about 1 hour yesterday under the hood in CAVU skies.  It seems that the nicer it is outside, the more apt the instructor will be to ask you to don the jepp goggles!  No failures on my flight, but that was probably a good thing as my performance was rusty.  Good luck on your demo tonight.  TTYS]]></description>
