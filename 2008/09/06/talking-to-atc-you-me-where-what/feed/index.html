					<description><![CDATA[Grant and Michael: thanks for the comments.  I agree with Grant that the IFR check-in can still fit the pattern, and I will try to do my best to post more for Michael.  In the meantime, here are some past postings that might be interesting:

					<description><![CDATA[Good way to lay it out - very KISS.

For consistency, I&#039;d even suggest that the last IFR &quot;exception&quot; isn&#039;t an exception at all.  The /what/ is either implied or can easily be stated in the same order as your other examples.  I.e. &quot;Halifax terminal, Bravo Juliet Oscar, at three thousand, checking in.&quot;  Or &quot;Halifax terminal, Bravo Juliet Oscar, leaving three thousand for six thousand, (&quot;with you&quot; implied).&quot;  or often: &quot;Halifax terminal, Bravo Juliet Oscar, (location understood from radar and previous contact), requesting direct Montreal.&quot;

Anyway - just to say that it&#039;s a great way to present this often intimidating topic.]]></description>
