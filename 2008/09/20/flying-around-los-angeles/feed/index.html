					<description><![CDATA[I got introduced to the crazy LA Airspace flying with my late friend Svend, a former flight engineer at Sterling where he was flying Bowing 727. I flew his C172 VFR (We Followed the Road) from Fullerton to French Valley on a typical low visibility LA Sunday. I would not do it by myself without GPS...

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. J: I flew my Warrior into Philadelphia International in December 2003, but (a) it was winter, and (b) it was IMC, so I didn&#039;t get a good idea of how smoggy it can get in the summer.  I think I departed VFR later that week, but I don&#039;t remember that well now.  The airport was a good deal at the time: no landing fee, and only $20/night parking at Atlantic (first night free with fuel).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In medical school, I was in Philadelphia. Now rated the second smoggiest air in the U.S.

I used to wear sunglasses with a blue tint when I flew! Didn&#039;t help the smog, but I could pretend the skies were blue and I felt better :-)]]></description>
