					<description><![CDATA[sidx: Originally, I used a variety of inputs to set a score automatically, including number and length of runways, published instrument approaches, possession of ICAO and IATA codes (IATA is worth more because it&#039;s rarer), presence in the top 100 airports list, and one or two other things.  I then set cutoffs for the three sizes.  Since then, however, I&#039;ve been editing some of them by hand, and I hope to open that up before too long.  I think that they&#039;re right most of the time, but some are obviously off by a category.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you&#039;re classifying the airports as Small/Medium/Large, what criterion are you using? The reason I ask is that it doesn&#039;t seem to hold based on the length of the longest runway or the MTOW of the heaviest aircraft that can land there (for a few airports I know). Is it categorized according to traffic?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Paul: Thanks right, it&#039;s ISO 3166-1 alpha 2.  That does have its issues (including slower ammendments when countries change), but it&#039;s well-known internationally, while FIPS 10-4 is used mainly in the U.S.  ISO 3166 is also well-known from domain names (modulo the UK/GB difference).]]></description>
