					<description><![CDATA[Obviously, a plane with CRT (or LCD) panels, metricating is easy. Just load in new  firmware. The backup gauges have to be changed though like the altimeter. But older planes will be a pain. And pilots will have to learn the new panel. The hazard is an emergency and the pilot gets confused in the heat of the moment.

Like the Mars mission, I wonder how many plane wrecks would occur during a changeover. Hopefully none, but I&#039;m sure a few will happen, of course. Having a switch for American/metric would help, but potentially cause confusion is multiple pilots share a plane. I guess you have to add &quot;check units selector&quot; as part of the pre-flight checklist. (Maybe Microsoft can add that button to Flight Sim)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Europe, all aviation releated generally is in nautical units, so feet for altitude, knots for speed, nautical miles for distance etc. Altimeter setting is in hPa. Visibility in METARs are in meters. Gliders, at least in Finland, use metric system for altitude and speed as well, also they set their altimeters for QFE(altimeter showing 0 on the ground) and not to QNH..

Russia and much of ex-Soviet Union uses metric system and QFE all the way, so does China.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can imagine that if anything will ever enable American pilots to make the leap to metric measurements, it will be the proliferation of &quot;glass&quot; cockpits. Selecting &quot;Metric&quot; in a system settings menu is a lot easier than replacing a panel&#039;s worth of steam gauges. That said, instrumentation markings are clearly only one very small piece of the puzzle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up with the metric system in Australia, but years of flying in California have made me all-too-comfortable with the US system. So it was very odd flying GA back in Australia a few years ago on a short visit -- altitudes in feet based on millibars, distances in nautical miles from runways whose lengths are measured in metres, airplane engines measured in horsepower but consuming litres of fuel, etc. In some ways the worst of both worlds....]]></description>
