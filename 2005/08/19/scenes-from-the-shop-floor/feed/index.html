					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Paul, and thanks especially for the two accident references.  They&#039;re interesting reading, and I plan to make a separate post about them.

The SR-20 and SR-22 are all electric, I think (even the standby gyros).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David,

I surprised people gave you a pass on the vacuum / retractible gear / IMC failure thingy.  I think we&#039;re going to see more with the SR-20 / SR-22s running around.  I think you can say most are retracts though.  Here are a couple:

MIA98FA045 12/24/1997 N12172  Cessna  172  Raleigh-Durham NC 	Fatal  	Personal
ATL91FA067 03/18/1991 N2871H  Piper   PA 28  Hamilton NC 	Fatal  	Business

BTW - the carb isn&#039;t always on the bottom.  In a few oddball aircraft, the cylinders are, or were on the bottom.  But, I think an updraft carb setup makes it easier to streamline the cowling.  I&#039;ve heard people say that it&#039;s safer to put the carb on the bottom, because when you overdo the throttle pump and get raw gas going, it just drains away.  I&#039;m not sure I think so, though.

Great blog, BTW
