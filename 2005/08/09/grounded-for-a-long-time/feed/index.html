					<description><![CDATA[Oh man, that&#039;s sad.  But I figured it couldn&#039;t have happened with you in the plane without you noticing.  I was in a AzTruck coming into Teterboro once where we were hit by something (don&#039;t know if it was lightning or something ground based) that made a very loud noise in the radios and caused both the pilots and my GPSes to blank out.  His GPS didn&#039;t come back until we were on the ground again, but mine came back in a few seconds.]]></description>
