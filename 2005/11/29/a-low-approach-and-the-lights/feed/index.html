					<description><![CDATA[Yup, the Aztec is oop and aboot.  The deicing stuff ended up being useful/needed during only short spurts the last few weeks.  Its most tangible effect is relative comfort of having it available - not having to chew one&#039;s fingers to the bone watching for minute ice buildup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The patient&#039;s backup plan was to reschedule the appointment.  Originally, I was down for backup in the morning and primary pilot in the afternoon, but nobody else stepped forward, so I agreed to fly both.

I hope that your twin is back in the air, Frank -- you must really appreciate the deicing system this time of year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was an unusual situation -- that ferocious low-level jet from the south was pulling in extremely warm air, producing record surface temperatures for late November (you must have had them in Rochester as well).  The freezing level was well above 10,000 feet, while MEAs for my route were down around 4,000.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Today, I had a chance to see what it was like having high-quality ground support during a volunteer Hope Air flight. I&#8217;ve already written about one part of my flight out to North Bay to pick up the patient and escort. By the time I got them back here to Ottawa for their early-afternoon appointment, I had already spent 4:30 in the air battling IMC, turbulence, heavy rain, and an 80-knot low-level jet from the south/southwest, all hand-flown (I don&#8217;t have an autopilot). When I started slurring words talking to the London FIC during the layover here in Ottawa, I realized that I was unsafe and grounded myself from the return trip (the rain and lowering freezing level at North Bay was also setting off alarms) &#8212; but now what? I had on my hands a father, son, and case worker who were planning to be home in North Bay for dinner. I thought about putting them on the bus (a long ride home), but then I decided to call Hope Air on the off chance that they could help. [...]]]></description>
