					<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon,

Was just reading the above post, and I&#039;m curious to know what you ideally would like to have access to when you&#039;re operating into airports and facilities where you have no &#039;ground support&#039;. What would the top priority areas be that you would have at your disposal under ideal circumstances??

Thanks!!!
