					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, phil.

The Warrior has the same problem with lack of temperature instrumentation: just oil temp and EGT (single cylinder).  Unless you always fly full rich, though, that&#039;s a problem no matter where you put the mixture.  The normal ROP lean setting is not too far about peak cylinder head temperatures, so you&#039;re even more likely to have a hot cylinder there than you are flying LOP-WOT.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[very informative blog.
Thanks

btw - I like the idea of cruising LOP (wide open throttle style), but the 172 does not have enough temp guages to assure me.]]></description>
