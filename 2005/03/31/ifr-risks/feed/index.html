					<description><![CDATA[Dave -- thanks for the comments! I&#039;ll probably respond in length on my own blog over the next few days when I have some spare time, but I&#039;d actually agree with what you&#039;re saying. I particularly agree that we don&#039;t get a lot of instruction or experience in real-world decision making, and that (e.g.) stressing graceful hold entries at the expense of such decision making is probably ludicrous at best. In short, though, I&#039;m still nervous of small plane single-pilot IFR in IMC -- but with another experienced IFR pilot along, I think your second scenario is an excellent idea, and I&#039;ll probably try it. But hey, we&#039;re just starting the Northern California non-winter, which means it may be 6-9 months before I see any real actual here beyond a few small layers of coastal stratus...]]></description>
