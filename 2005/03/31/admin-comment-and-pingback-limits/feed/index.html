					<description><![CDATA[I use blogger.com for all my ylayali.com blogs including YAFB, and have it set so that you must be a blogger.com member to make comments. I.e. no comment spam -- but also, very few comments (well, it&#039;s not like there&#039;s much to comment on in what I say...). I&#039;ve found that people often email me instead, but that&#039;s no subsititute for public commentary. I don&#039;t know the best answer, but I deliberately shied away from the whole MT thing because of the comment spam...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t comment about Blogger.  But when I was on MovableType I was using MT-Blacklist and closing old comments after 30 days, and that worked pretty well.  Since I moved to WordPress 1.5 last month, I haven&#039;t had a single comment spam.  I installed SpamKarma, and it hasn&#039;t caught anything.  I also checked the option that blocks comments from open relays, and as far as I know that doesn&#039;t actually tell you when it blocks stuff.

SpamKarma for WordPress does everything that MT-Blacklist does (including the automatic updates), and a whole lot more.  Try it, you&#039;ll like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use Roller Weblogger. It filters out most of the comment spam using the MT-Blacklist, which is automatically updated for me (a super nice feature given how busy I am). I recommend checking out the MT-Blacklist at http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/ and seeing if you can incorporate it into your blogger. Otherwise, check out Roller Weblogger. It&#039;s Java Servlet based and can connect to Postgresql or MySQL.]]></description>
