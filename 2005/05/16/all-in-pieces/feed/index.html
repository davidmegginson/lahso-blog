					<description><![CDATA[I try not to look at part prices too often, because they make me realize that I could part out my Warrior (at, say, 50% of the price for the used parts) and have enough money to buy a plane worth 2-4 times as much.  The little steel stiffener plate for my propeller spinner (actually, the *backup* stiffener plate) costs about US $530 list -- it&#039;s only US $175 used from Wentworth, but they don&#039;t provide any paperwork that I can use to install it legally.

I ordered what appears to be the last one available in North America, but Piper somehow managed to lose it in shipment to the parts supplier, so now Piper&#039;s promising to make a new one if they cannot find it.  Check back in this fall to see if I&#039;m flying again yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the advantages of being a pilot is to make car maintenance costs trivial. I&#039;ve had an auto mechanic call me up to tell me that a part is necessary, but unfortunately quite expensive. And then he goes on in grave tones to tell me that it will cost $43.27, including the taxes. I have to restrain my laughter, before I approve the expenditure. And he doesn&#039;t need to order it from Wichita, either.]]></description>
