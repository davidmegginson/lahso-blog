					<description><![CDATA[Actually no I didn&#039;t...  I&#039;d evaluated 4 different packages and for the moment I&#039;m happy with what this one can do.  It also seems simple enough that I could write my own plugins if there is some feature I really want.  I&#039;m part of that slashdot crowd you see..  ;)   Lately I&#039;ve been reading with great interest about the laptop based GPS systems out there.. seeing as I may be in the market for one soon.  Compared to the standalone units that cost at least as much (if not more) the idea of a computer based one appeals to me.. it&#039;s an area I&#039;m familiar with.  I&#039;ve built one into my truck before... the only problem being a daylight readable small touch screen... but it seems those are readily available for aviation. Those combined with the XM weather looks pretty slick for a portable unit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best of luck on the check ride, Jared -- just stay relaxed and do what you already know.

WordPress does have a lot of plugins available.  Did you check them to see if you could find any missing features?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks good..  I just installed wordpress for someone else (through guru.com)..  I like the clean look.. but it lacks a few things I&#039;d like to see.  I&#039;m a pre check ride student and I&#039;ve enjoyed reading your site...  I&#039;m just getting my feet wet with software called Serendipity.  Wish me luck as the check ride is scheduled for the 27th!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s my test comment.

Not that I&#039;m jealous or anything, but I&#039;ve never had a spam comment on any blog.

Blogger has just put capchas (however you spell that) on their system, but I think they are only triggered by posting comments or posts in quick succession, not single comments or posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using SpamKarma for months now.  It took the spammers many, many months to realize that my blog isn&#039;t running on MovableType (although I still see attempts to access mt-tb.cgi even now), but so far it&#039;s deleted a bunch of real spams and falsely accused one person who had the comment form up for several hours before he got around to submitting his comment.

If you install &quot;Paged Comment Editing&quot; as well, comments that were flagged as spam can be gotten to and either retrieved to be posted or mass deleted.]]></description>
