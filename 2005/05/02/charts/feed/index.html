					<description><![CDATA[I like this idea. For VFR, I think any chart will provide you with something that&#039;s better than nothing. I used to carry a little note pad bound in a vinyl folder that measured about 8x6 when closed. To the inside of this, opposite my notepad, I had taken a section out of a VNC (Visual Navigation Chart, often known as a VFR chart), and glued it to the folder. This way, I always had a pen and paper handy, should it be needed (mind you, this would come in handier IFR for copying clearances and such than it would be VFR), and I always had a map of my local area, where almost all of my recreational flying would take place. Good post!]]></description>
