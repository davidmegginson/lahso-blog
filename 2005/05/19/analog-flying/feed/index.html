					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely! When I was a student, many years ago, we did a number of experiments to determine the optimum way of presenting information and we found that white figures/needles on a black background worked best. Moreover, we found that, as you state, you remember the position, the picture, not the reading. I have flown a glass cockpit, and I found that the use of strip displays for altitude, speed, etc terribly difficult to interpret, whereas with the old analog instruments the &#039;picture&#039; gave you all the information at a glance, there was no &#039;picture&#039; with the strip gauges, you had to read the numbers and then translate that into what the current state was. So, if I could have a glass cockpit and have the data displayed as analog instruments, I would be happy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started using this technique on my last couple flights and I have to say that it is quite valuable.  In fact, I don&#039;t know why my instructor never mentioned it.  I&#039;m trying to train myself to take quick glances for needle position and make the adjustments more frequently.  I&#039;d love to get to where I do this subconsciously.  This quick evaluation can only take place if you reduce the amount of information you have to process.  That s why the needle position is useful...don&#039;t even focus on the numbers.  Thanks a lot for the tip! - Dan Larson, Private Pilot Instrument, Jeffco Aiport - Colorado]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll second your ideas... I work in technology and so I&#039;ve seen both bad and good interfaces.  Whenever you have to read and interpret something it&#039;s going to take more brain cycles than if you can just look at it and recognize a problem.  This could be by the use of color.. shape.. or other spacial relationship that can be understood simply by looking at it.  Also.. the less cluttered the better.

I have not used a glass cockpit either... but I know one thing I would look for is a way to turn off labels for things.  As you learn the positions and readouts you should be able to declutter the screen by turning off any unneeded text.  Then if something is abnormal..  the change would be more apparent.]]></description>
