					<description><![CDATA[I liked this story.  Reminds me of when Toronto Center ATC reminds and informs pilots of non-radar procedures.  Plus, a few pilots have wondered if the radar based in Hearst will ever upgrade or expand coverage, unfortunately it will not.  As an aviation enthusiast myself, it&#039;s interesting following aircraft by position reports vs the radar followed aircraft when I listened from North Bay.  I&#039;m glad you liked Timmins, come again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To Noncommercial Pilots,
I may well be out of line searching, but does anyone know of someone flying to Timmins Ontario Thursday evening or Friday morning? (August 4, 5th)
Or returning Friday evening or Saturday morning. I have a funeral to go to but am unable to get rid of ER shifts Thurs 8am to 5pm and Saturday 4pm till midnight.
Public flights are impossible.
So far, I am taking the bus at midnight Thursday, will have 7 hours in Timmins,  and take the bus back at 7:45pm Friday (to arrive in Ottawa Saturday morning).  Therefore, 24 hours on the bus for 7.5 hours in Timmins to visit the family of the deceased.
Deceased:  Cyril James Hamerski, born 1954

Does anyone need to log hours?  How much $$$$ for me to pay for the flight in and out same day, and you log the hours?

Thanks,
Christine Johns CCFP-EM (ER-MD The Ottawa Hospital: 613-761-4928)
613-864-4687]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It&#039;s not the latitude, it&#039;s the attitude.&quot;

That is the best explanation I&#039;ve seen of what north means in Canada. Capital N-North is properly defined, like getting a northern living allowance on your income tax.  But Sault Ste. Marie sits squarely ON the US border, yet is in &#039;northern Ontario&#039;, while no one would ever Calgary &#039;northern Alberta.&#039;]]></description>
