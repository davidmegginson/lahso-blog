					<description><![CDATA[[...] My Warrior&#8217;s engine is finally back from overhaul in Halifax after it&#8217;s lighting strike, and I hope to be back in the air in a bit over a week. Next month, I&#8217;m planning a long (7+ hour) flight from Ottawa down to Atlanta to speak at the XML 2005 conference. If you are one of the large group of people who share an interest in both technology and flying, I&#8217;d love to see you there: I don&#8217;t plan to talk about flying from the podium, but would love to chat about it in the halls or over a drink or meal.

					<description><![CDATA[[...] I&#8217;m still AOG, 9 days after discovering evidence of a minor lightning strike. Other than the depolarized magnetic compass, the only damage from the strike is a tiny blister at the end of the prop, easily within tolerances for filing out (see photo). However, because of the amount of heat involved, the prop had to go to Mississauga for hardness testing at Hope Aero (one of Canada&#8217;s three prop shops). [...]]]></description>
