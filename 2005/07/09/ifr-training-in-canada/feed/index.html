					<description><![CDATA[Training Guy: a lot of the training in Canada takes place through flying clubs, which are typically large-ish non-profit FBOs, though we also have for-profit flying schools.  What part of Canada are you interested in?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most ILS approaches in Canada have an NDB where the outer marker would be in the U.S. (i.e. like an LOM).  As Paul knows already from his IFR flying in Canada, there&#039;s usually an NDB approach corresponding to each ILS approach, and it serves as a backup when the localizer is U/S.  That&#039;s what&#039;s happening in Halifax right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The three large controlled airports in the north west of New York state, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, have all had their NDBs decomissioned.  Now if you want to do NDB training around here you have to go to Penn Yann which is uncontrolled and the NDB is right on the field.  I find those ones with the NDB right on the field (instead of coincident with the outer marker for the ILS approach a lot easier to fly because even if you&#039;re homing instead of doing proper wind correction you&#039;ll end up at the end of the runway.]]></description>
