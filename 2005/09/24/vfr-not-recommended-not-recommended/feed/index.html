					<description><![CDATA[Paul&#039;s been flying for a while (and is based in the U.S. right now).  In Ottawa, before the Quebec FIC took over, I think that pilots used to call the Gatineau FSS for briefings.  In Oshawa, before the London FIC took over, I assume that pilots used to call the Buttonville FSS, but I never flew into Oshawa.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As for the phrase VFNR in Canada,  It was always used as a &quot;cover your ass&quot; for the specialist and Nav Canada. However, NavCan realized that if us as briefers were saying VFNR in 9 out of 10 briefings, but the 1 where it wasn&#039;t said, but should have (based on the subjective requirements) resulted in an accident, there could be a whole world of liability.  Thus the phrase has been dropped.  As a specialist, I believe the phrase for the most part, was most beneficial low time pilots with poor weather knowledge or english as a second language.  Would get there attention immediately.
As far as I know, the FSS in the states have a reputation for using VFNR even if one station out of ten along the route was reporting CB&#039;s with all the rest being CAVU.
Out of curiosity with a question to Paul Tomblin, who do you call for a briefing in Oshawa or Ottawa? You mean London?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The problem with &quot;VFNR&quot; is that it was applied so inconstently even within the same FSS, at least in the US.  There was one briefer who frequently said &quot;VFNR&quot; at the beginning of a briefing for a local flight, even though the ceiling was going to stay above 5,000 feet for several hours.  Another would not say it even with ceilings at 2,500 and rain.

I don&#039;t know if my experiences are typical, but I&#039;ve found calling weather briefers in both Oshawa and Ottawa that they are *far* more forthcoming with information that isn&#039;t in the standard briefing.  They&#039;d tell me what the forecast said, and then add why they thought the forecast might be wrong or why the radar map I was looking at didn&#039;t show the whole story.]]></description>
