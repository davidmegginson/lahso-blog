					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really agree because this avoids the question of how you get up there in the first place. If the cloud layer is thick, you really don&#039;t want to have to climb through thousands of feet of possible icing to get up there. Second point is, assuming that you do climb and you pick up ice at e.g. 5000 and the temperature is well below zero at 9000, it will take a while for the ice to dissappear by sublimation. In addition, you&#039;ll be nicely cold when you eventually have to descend, so you might pick up ice even more easily. Also, since icing varies locally, you guarentees you that you won&#039;t be picking up ice all the way down from 9000 to say 5000 at your destination?]]></description>
