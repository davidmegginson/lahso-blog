					<description><![CDATA[Dear Sir aclassic example of impeded egress from an inverted floatplane is a cessna 206 rear door mechanism,when flaps are deployed they are useless for exit .However there is a modification approved by Australian a/c safety authority that allow s the rear doors to operate.My question is why is there so much red tape when approving simple safety modes that will save lives]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] A short while ago, I wrote about the problem with float planes &#8212; the fact that there&#8217;s normally no way to get out when they flip upside down or sink &#8212; and about the war of words between the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (who want an airworthiness directive requiring the installing of escape hatches) and Transport Canada (who claim they are unable to issue one, since many of the type certificates are not Canadian).
