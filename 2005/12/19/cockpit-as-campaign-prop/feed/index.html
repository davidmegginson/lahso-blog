					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t imagine it would have made sense for Duceppe to use a jet, since his campaign was limited to Quebec.  Something like a Dash-8 would have been sufficient to carry him and the Quebec press corps, and would be able to get into the smaller runways in northern communities -- I&#039;m just guessing, though.

If Layton didn&#039;t use a jet, he must have had a slow campaign of it criss-crossing the country.]]></description>
