					<description><![CDATA[Blake, at one time you *could* get the data from Energy Mines and Resources.  But after NavCanada came along, they stopped selling it because the data that we as Canadian taxpayers paid to have collected was no longer ours.

Then a few years ago I tried to get NavCanada to cough it up.  They said they wouldn&#039;t release it because of liability issues.  I said I&#039;d sign a release.  They said they would ask their lawyers.  The lawyers never got back to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn... I wish I knew about Aeroplanner earlier! ;)

I really think we should focus our efforts on trying to get NavCanada/TC to produce digital versions of their data. The FAA does it, why can&#039;t NavCan?]]></description>
