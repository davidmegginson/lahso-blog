					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the report, Anthony.  Normally, I clear customs at Massena, NY (KMSS) and then land at Norwood (KOWD), which is near two commuter rail lines into Boston.  I&#039;m tempted by Bedford only because of the customs on the field, because it&#039;s about the same distance from downtown Boston as Norwood is (though it&#039;s a few miles closer to Ottawa).  I wonder if I should take my chances on MassPort failing to send me a bill.  Did you clear customs there?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve landed at Bedford and was advised of all of the fees and now 7 months later I&#039;m still to get my bill. It&#039;s a great airport and everyone was very friendly but certainly on paper the fees are outrageous. It was a great flight flying through all of New York to and from Toronto. I may or may not return to Bedford given the fees (if I ever get billed) but aside from costs the trip was well worth it.
