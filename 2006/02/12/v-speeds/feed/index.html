					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Dave -- &quot;altimeter&quot; was just a simple typo (you&#039;ll notice that the picture is an ASI), and I&#039;ve corrected it.  I find that Wikipedia is actually pretty good on technical topics once an article settles.  The trick is learning to recognize an article&#039;s level of maturity, which isn&#039;t easy at first.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a bit put off by your first paragraph.  I&#039;m only a private pilot and a long-inactive one at that, but all the critical performance and limit speeds I&#039;ve ever seen marked on a cockpit instrument have been on the airspeed indicator, not the altimeter.

I&#039;m not sure if this was your gotcha or Wikipedia&#039;s, I find that site pretty useless myself in most any technical area, but like bubble-brained TV newscasters and newspapers that don&#039;t know their country&#039;s geography, it seems very popular in today&#039;s world.

A very good job, though, on explaining a _lot_ about critical speeds I never learned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The FAA&#039;s Airplane Flying Handbook has a small section on this topic, but I think your version is more readable. I find student pilots often overlook the formula for adjusting V-speeds for less than gross weight.

Another way to approximate Va is to multiply Vs by the square root of the maximum positive load factor for the aircraft. I like to teach this to students so that they see the relationship between stall speed and maneuvering speed. The maneuvering speed is calculated so that if turbulence causes the wing to reach the critical angle of attack, the wing should stall (and unload) PRIOR to exceeding the maximum positive load factor.]]></description>
