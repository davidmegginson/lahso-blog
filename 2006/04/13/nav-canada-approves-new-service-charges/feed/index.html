					<description><![CDATA[There are a number of issues facing general aviation.  I do feel that user fees are definitely the &#039;cause of the moment&#039; however.  Therefore, I have sponsored a Pledge Campaign on YouChoose.net and urge you all to sign in and support the fight against these fees.  YouChoose can also be used to rally pilots around the other attacks on general aviation as well.

					<description><![CDATA[[...] So much for that. I&#8217;ll add 45 minutes to my trip, clear customs for free (in Massena, NY or Burlington, VT), then land at one of the airports just outside MassPort&#8217;s ring of control and ride the commuter train in, as I&#8217;ve done three times in the past. Check out the MassPort fee page to see how easily bad government can take the fun out of flying &#8212; it makes the forthcoming Nav Canada big-airport user fees look tame in comparison.

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Now, thought, the costs are catching up with me. I have a very good deal on a tie-down spot with plug-in at the big airport, but when I add up landing fees and other costs, I figure that it&#8217;s costing me about $1,000/year more to park at Macdonald-Cartier than it will at Rockcliffe (they&#8217;re the same distance from my house), even when I factor in two diversions/year for weather and the resulting cab fares and parking expenses. Next year, when Nav Canada brings in their new user fees for large airports, I calculate that the price difference will jump to $1,500/year. I won&#8217;t guess how hard a commercial pilot like Aviatrix or Sulako has to work to make that much, but it&#8217;s a lot for me, too, especially with two daugthers hitting university in the next decade.
