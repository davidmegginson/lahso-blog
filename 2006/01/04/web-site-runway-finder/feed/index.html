					<description><![CDATA[The website at

   http://www.flyagogo.net

has draggable and zoomable sectional charts, a live visible and infrared satellite weather and nexrad radar returns view, a google maps view, and offers an extensive aviation database, airport photos, decoded METARs, METAR history, and  more. There is a help page which describes these features in more detail.

The website went online a week ago. Give it a try - I am interested to get your feedback at info@flyagogo.net. The site is under constant development. Click the blog link if you are interested.

Cheers,
- Leif.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post about RunwayFinder. After a bit of a break, I&#039;m working on improvements again. A few people have requested the ability to bookmark a location, so I&#039;ll add that. Frank pinged me about adding Canadian airports, which I&#039;ll do as well.

I also wish that the Canadian charts were available in an inexpensive digital form. I can buy all of the U.S. mainland sectionals and terminals for $23.40. Now that is a bargain!]]></description>
