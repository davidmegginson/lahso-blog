					<description><![CDATA[Flying clubs in the U.S. are very different from clubs in Canada -- from what I understand, they&#039;re often informal groups of a few people who have joined together to buy a plane (or two).  I suggest that you start by asking around at local airports and other places where pilots gather (FAA seminars, EAA meetings, etc.).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Niss, who flies out of Barrie Airpark (CNA3), left this comment on my posting Should I buy or rent? (divide all prices by about 1.2 to get US dollars): I am looking to buy a share in an aircraft. Right now at my local airport (CNA3) there is a 1966 Piper Cherokee 140 on the ramp. The owner is looking for $32500 and I am told that he might be interested in selling off 25% Shares. TTSN: 5693 HRs SMOH: 1917 HRs, cylinders were redone 400 hours ago. The broker that is selling it is my old boss and mentor at the airport, so I know the salesman and the owner are reputable. Also I am a student, am looking to go on to bigger and better things including my CPL and other rateings. What do you guys think this animal would cost in maintenace fees, etc? Would you say this is a wise decision for a student? [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think a partnership or equity club is the best way to go.  That way you are an owner, but you are not all alone when paying the bills or facing one of the many small challenges of ownership.

And as the other poster said, people won&#039;t be tearing the airplanes up.  You&#039;ll pretty much know the state of your plane before you leave for the airport.

I could go on and on, but if you plan on flying more than just an hour or so a month then you need to get equity in an airplane.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to both Pauls for the comments.  Here in Canada, a flying club is normally a not-for-profit FBO: some of them started in the 1920s or 1930s, then participated with the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during World War II.  I am not aware of any clubs like the ones you both mention, and I&#039;m not sure how insurance and regulations would work up here.

If you live somewhere that has a lot of rental planes normally sitting idle on the tarmac, that&#039;s fantastic -- go for it.  The places I&#039;ve been try to keep all their planes in the air as often as possible, and sell planes off if they sit idle too long, especially with the high cost of insurance now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another option is a flying club.  In many instances, it gives you all the advantages of fractional ownership, and all of the advantages of renting.

The club that I&#039;m involved with has an annual dues approximately equal to what renter&#039;s insurance would cost you.  For that money, you get access to 5 different aircraft, which the club members treat like one of their own.  Unlike a rental, club members don&#039;t fly fully rich all the time, leave garbage in the planes, or land with the parking brakes on (well, hardly ever) because of the sense of ownership.  The club allows you to take the planes for extended trips, and the only time they enforce the minimal hours per day is if you&#039;re being a dick-head.  Club members frequently take two or three of the planes to Oshkosh and let them sit on the ground for four or five days, and only pay the 8 hours it takes to fly there and back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it depends where you live. Out here in the CA desert the local flying school has 1 172 and 2 152s, the latter renting at around US$90 an hour, US$120 for the 172. Your argument definitely applies here.

However, if I drive to San Diego I am a member of a flying club with probably 15-20 172&#039;s, not to mention another 20 or so other types. I can rent a 182RG for not much more than the local 172. Because of the number of planes I can almost always get a cross-country trip with one to two week&#039;s notice. In this case the cost and availabilty probably isn&#039;t too far off the benefit of owning.

Having said that, I&#039;d still love to own!]]></description>
