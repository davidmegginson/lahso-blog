					<description><![CDATA[Hi All Experts,
Does anyone use google earth images as ground image planes for use in aerial scenes. I know how to stitch them together but are there any tools or tricks to make sure that the images are at the same height, angle and such to make sure they stitch well. I know in the pro version you can get bigger images but im not going to pay for the pro version when i could stitch multiple images together...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also a plugin (or add-on, or however they&#039;re referred to in Google-speak) for Google Earth that will add 3D airspace for the United States.  I&#039;ve used it to &quot;fly&quot; through the L.A. basin with a student and show them the multiple layers of airspace you&#039;ll find in many parts of the L.A. area.

Much like the plugin you referenced, this one eats up a lot of bandwidth.

Add this to the list of things I meant to write about on my site...
