					<description><![CDATA[Hello there !

 I was up flying the past few days and the winds have been pretty crazy. The highest they got around Ottawa that we saw at FL200 was around 85 kts which is pretty strong for that level. Yesterday on approach for RWY32 we had a 52 kt wind till about 3000 feet.

Once in Caravan with a 65 kt wind at 5000 feet I put out the flaps when I was empty and ended up flying backward at 10 kts. If only I was IFR to see the controller wondering when I was doing 0 kts :)

Safe flying !]]></description>
