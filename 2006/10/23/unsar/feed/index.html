					<description><![CDATA[I have had a few times where I had to go flying in the arctic with a portable ELT as the main one was out for service.
I always had visions of the accident chain starting there....

&quot;The ELT was out for recertification and the hand held did not last long enough for the pilot to be rescued&quot; :)

But I am still here posting comments so its all good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for putting it in perspective, Paul: the UNSAR caused hassle for a lot of people, but at least the plane will be back in the air soon (and I&#039;m free to take it for a local flight right now if I want).  The only question is whether my replacement ELT battery (an unusual type, of course) will arrive in time for my Hope Air flight on Wednesday. My avionics tech kindly put aside everything else to look at the ELT today.]]></description>
