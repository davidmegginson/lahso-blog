					<description><![CDATA[According to data a pilot posted on a private list, the aircraft required just slightly more than the 3500&#039; available to reach Vr, and the balanced runway length was around 5800&#039;. Can&#039;t find the e-mail I&#039;m paraphrasing.

And surely you know it isn&#039;t a &#039;commercial flight&#039; in the media unless it departs from a terminal equiipped with computer screens, and has jet engines, washrooms and flight attendants.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did listen in on that press conference and you are correct, the NTSB spokesperson did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; say that commercial planes are not supposed to use that runway. I can&#039;t recall &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what she said, but she was extremely careful with her words to avoid saying they were using the wrong runway.

I believe what happened is one of the reporters said something like &quot;isn&#039;t runway 22 the runway used by commercial planes and runway 26 used by small planes?&quot; to which she said something like &quot;all we know is the aircraft data showed the aircraft was lined up on and departed runway 26.&quot; I&#039;m likely way off on the quote, but that is the gist of it.]]></description>
