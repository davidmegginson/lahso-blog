					<description><![CDATA[Lake Simcoe is awesome cottage country. The sky is like you wouldn&#039;t believe in the city, you can actually see the Milky Way and smaller and smaller stars in between each other. Oh, look! There goes the satellite :-) Still, there are all usual stores nearby.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice article David!

Here in Barrie we are stuck between Georgian Bay and Kempenfelt Bay (Lake Simcoe) as well as Lake Ontario to our south.
It can make for some interesting weather and can make life difficult when it comes to getting a good day to fly.

Oh well C&#039;est la vie!

Cheers]]></description>
