					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark,

 Came across this list of direct FSS numbers I found when looking Flight service phone numbers for a trip I&#039;m
planning.  I had the same concern that I would not get the &quot;correct&quot; one.  But this should make it easy ?

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Mark -- that&#039;s bad news about the cell phone.  I wonder if it depends now on the carrier (I use Bell Mobility).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was down in OshKosh this weekend and unfortunately our Canadian cellphone was not able to access the 1-800-WX-BRIEF.  The worst part was the pay phone nearest our camping spot on the field had the numbers 1 and 8 U/S.  AND the telephone operator would NOT dial the number for me, no matter what I said.
Needless to say, we made a flight itinerary with some folks back home and flew out.
I had read your blog before I left and was excited to hear that news.

Otherwise I have no complaints about the US FSS.  They are great people who will try to do as much as possible for you.
