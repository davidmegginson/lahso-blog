					<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re waiving them for COPA members -- the Esso FBO, at least, has a sign-up sheet where you write your name, COPA membership #, and tail number.  The Esso is also asking AOPA members to sign the sheet, in the hope that the airport will extend the deal.

The landing fees never made sense -- by the time you reckon the administrative costs of recording my tail number, tracking down my name and address, creating an invoice, mailing it to me (and also a reminder if I don&#039;t pay promptly), then processing and depositing my cheque, I&#039;m guessing that the airport was losing at least $10-20 on each landing fee they billed for my Warrior.  Sault Ste. Marie (CYAM) has also cancelled landing fees for light aircraft, probably for similar reasons.]]></description>
