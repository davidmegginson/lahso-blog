					<description><![CDATA[Sorry it took me a while to respond to this.  Terrorists win a tactical victory every time they make people afraid, similar to an army winning a battle. Winning a strategic victory &#8212; e.g., a war &#8212; is always trickier, especially since different (temporarily) allied groups cannot usually agree on the ideal outcome: U.S. out of the Middle East? U.S. in the Middle East but not on holy ground? U.S. in the Middle East but only if they behave responsibly?  Sharia law?  Democracy instead of monarchies? Jews/Sunnis/Shia/Druze/Arabs/Kurds/Turks/Parsi in/out of [fill in the region]?  And that&#039;s just the Middle East.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; [...] Terrorists win whenever they make people afraid [...]

I&#039;m starting to doubt this popular adage.  All the terrorist attacks
I&#039;ve heard of have ulterior motives beyond &quot;terror&quot;.  If they really
thought that fear, having been duly caused many times now, was a
victory, then they&#039;d stop terrorizing.

No, they want more stuff.  The islamic bunch wants something regarding
israel and a caliphate.  The IRA wanted the UK out of northern ireland.
And so on.  Mere fear is more likely a means to the end.]]></description>
