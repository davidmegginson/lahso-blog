					<description><![CDATA[Actually I was there the next day and from what I heard from some pilots milling about was that he did indeed attempt a single engine take off after not being able to start his engine on the ground.

Seems unbelievable but it happens. Get there-itis really gets to some people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well the fact the airplane _could_ do it is hardly a question .. twins have been doing single -engine takeoff&#039;s since the Douglas DC-1 days at least.  But the idea that any pilot in his right mind would be so confident in his abilities that he _should_ do it gives me the willies.

If I had my way, his medical would be pulled for life do to demonstrated insanity ... but since he was only slightly injured in the crash, no doubt he&#039;ll be out there again flying another airpane.  Sad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s more surprising is that this crazy fellow did actually get airborne
on one engine, just lost control after hitting that tree.  So the plane can
do it ... but somehow that does not make me interested in replicating the stunt.]]></description>
