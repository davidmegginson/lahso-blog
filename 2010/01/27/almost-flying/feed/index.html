					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t been flying since September either. Anxious to get back in the air. A little more painful since I rent as I need to get &quot;current&quot; again on the schools aircraft. Boo.

My &quot;buy an airplane&quot; fund is slowly increasing in value ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The old wing covers are in my trunk (soon, in my garage) -- they need some patching over tears, but they&#039;re yours if you want them.  There are places in Ottawa that can patch them up for you (anyone who does boat covers, etc.).

You can&#039;t put a car battery in a plane, but you can use one to jump start a plane, assuming you have a 14v electrical system (as I do), and not a 28v electrical system like some newer planes have.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, what did you do with your old, lesser wing covers?
