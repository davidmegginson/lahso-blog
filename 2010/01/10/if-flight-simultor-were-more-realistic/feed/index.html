					<description><![CDATA[The latest A2A Simulations birds are taking that kind of realism two notches up, they are &quot;living&quot;, aging creatures (or Tamagochis if you will) with a surprisingly high complexity.  The only thing they&#039;re (kind of) lacking is simulating other idiots using the plane in the meantime, messing up the intercom, fouling the plugs or not mentioning the collapsing backrest of the left seat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[very true man.  I should start preflighting the sim just to make it more realistic.  or call WX brief and talk to Lockheed for 15 minutes before I hop in.

good points all around, and an even better blog.  thanks for writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, You should have called.  I work for beer, or flight hours but do cut down your useful load by a large factor!

Sorry to hear your plane wasn&#039;t as ready as you were but at least we got to see the sun for a moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Louis.  Not a bad suggestion on a day like today: I could even overlook the fact that all the club planes have the wings attached in the wrong place, up above the doors instead of underneath them.  Do you have a new valet service, so that I don&#039;t have to read over the journey log, and uncover, untie, preflight, and refuel the plane? :)

Seriously, when my plane&#039;s actually working, I like being able to take it on long family trips, business trips, etc. and just park it at a different airport for a week.  I like the 665 lb full-fuel useful load, the 125 kt true airspeed, and even the scratched-up, hard-to-see Stormscope mounted under the yoke(?!?). I guess I&#039;m fond of the old hunk of aluminum, despite all my complaining: it fits me like an old sweater.]]></description>
