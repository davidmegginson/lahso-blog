					<description><![CDATA[Much-belated follow-up on the Spot. I did end up getting one, and it worked well for a number of years. After I upgraded to an IFR GPS (Garmin GTN 650) last summer, however, I was losing signal every ~10 minutes, and the GPS had to reestablish its satellites. It turned out that the 10-minute heartbeat from the Spot was interfering with the WAAS antenna, and that it&#039;s a known issue with the GTN series.  So I didn&#039;t renew my subscription, and the Spot is just sitting in a Rubbermaid container now, with other unused flying stuff.  I might try a Garmin InReach some time soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure what Viennatech is talking about. I have my SPOT on every time I fly in the Arctic Circle of Alaska and it has yet to fail reporting my position to the webpage. I also happen to use it for many other events in our area (including some involving actual searches) and have not had any problems. Our Regional SAR crew carry them as well. While they are proprietary, if you do happen to activate the emergency function the local authorities will be made VERY aware of the situation and position. I do not get any compensation from the SPOT company in any form. As the Fire Chief and SAR Coordinator for an area the size of the State of Indiana, I recommend SPOTs to anyone traveling in our very remote region of northwest Alaska where there are no roads to connect communities.  SPOTs communicate with satellites, not cellular towers.  Needless to say, we don&#039;t have many cell towers out here in the tundra.  On a more personal note, my better half gets rather upset when I forget to throw the SPOT in the dash of the plane. On the other hand, she also gets a little upset when I am late for dinner and she knows I landed in plenty of time (she watches the webpage when I&#039;m flying) to get home on time. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was sold on spot until I read about how the spot system is entirely proprietary to their company and that it does not give off any &quot;elt&quot; type signal.  It instead relies on breadcrumb trail that is uploaded over cellular networks as you fly along.  I know my cell phone barely works in most places of Canada, how can we be sure Spot will?  More doubt comes from here http://www.wildsnow.com/2323/plb-rescue-beacon-acr/ 
 Guess 121.5 will have to stay in the Piper for now.  Regardless of what the FCC likes to think about it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Blake.  I&#039;m getting more and more tempted by the Spot, myself.  What I really want is affordable TCP/IP via satellite, so that we can have Internet-driven displays in the cockpit.]]></description>
