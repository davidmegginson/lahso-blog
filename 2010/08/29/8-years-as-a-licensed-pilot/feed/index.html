					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/29/8-years-as-a-licensed-pilot/#comment-1737&quot;&gt;Patrick Pohler&lt;/a&gt;.

Absolutely right, Patrick.  

I wish I could have loved local recreational flying more, because it would have been less work (and money) and a great social experience, but I was bitten by the distant-horizons bug.  On the most recent page of my log book, every single flight was cross-country.  

In Canada, maintaining an instrument rating is an even bigger hassle than in the U.S. — we have to keep up currency like you do (we call it &quot;recency&quot;), but we also have to retake the entire IFR flight test every two years with an examiner in the right seat.  

I wouldn&#039;t bother if I didn&#039;t need it, but I would have had to cancel or postpone almost half my flights this summer without an instrument rating: when you&#039;re flying 200-500 nm in the summer, there&#039;s often IMC somewhere along the route even when the airports at both ends are good VFR.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its good to find a level of recreational flying that suits your needs and desires. I&#039;ve let my instrument lapse simply because I don&#039;t do a lot of long cross-country flying. I&#039;m usually stuck between the desire to keep up my instrument proficiency (to protect my training &quot;investment&quot;) and my pocketbook/time. I&#039;ve found that while I have a lot of fun training for a new certification or rating, after I get it I revert to puttering around the pattern or short $100 hamburger trips in central Ohio.]]></description>
