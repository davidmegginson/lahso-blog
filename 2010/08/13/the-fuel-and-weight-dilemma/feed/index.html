					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lahso.megginson.com/2010/08/13/the-fuel-and-weight-dilemma/#comment-1710&quot;&gt;Frank Ch. Eigler&lt;/a&gt;.

Frank is right — I&#039;d trust my fuel gauges about as much as I&#039;d trust a drunk Republican senator in a room full of pages.  For fuel management, however, I have a couple of advantages over both of you:

Unlike Frank, I fly a single-engine plane with a fixed-pitch prop, and have a much smaller range of altitudes, so I don&#039;t have as many variables to control: at any given power setting, my fuel flow is very predictable.

Unlike Blake, I&#039;ve been flying the same plane for almost 8 years and 700 hours, so I know it pretty well.  For the past few years, I&#039;ve calculated my fuel burn after almost every flight (writing many of them in the journey log), and I can normally predict it to within 0.2 gal/hour now.

Still, I like to land with at least an hour&#039;s reserve in the tanks even when I&#039;m VFR.  You have to be wrong only once ...]]></description>

Even with a calibrated dipstick, you&#039;d only know with certainty the fuel amount at the start of the flight.  If your fuel pressure / flow / level gauges are not precise &#038; accurate to the same extent, concerns about fuel are quite rational.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just one question: In your chart you have two rows: 20, and 24 gals. Is your fuel measuring device accurate enough to detect 2 gals of fuel in each tank?

My experience with fuel measurement has always been using a dip stick. &quot;3/4 tanks&quot; or &quot;1/2 tanks&quot; is usually the measurement. Not &quot;21 gallons&quot;. So how do you accurately determine how much fuel is in each tank?

Maybe this is a reason why my greatest fear with flying is fuel exhaustion. I haven&#039;t had the luxury of using an accurate method of determining on board fuel quantity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have an ironic version of this problem.  My airplane has a huge full-fuel payload and good CG range, so carrying the entire family (even in their adult future girth) is not a problem.  Therefore, I have become a bit complacent about careful calculations of this or that, knowing that the plane will safely take it.

However, once in a long while, a larger load appears - whether an extra adult, or an unusual quantity of cargo.  I have to remember to whip out the rusty W&#038;B calculator from its dusty corner and check things.  I may have forgotten once or twice.]]></description>
