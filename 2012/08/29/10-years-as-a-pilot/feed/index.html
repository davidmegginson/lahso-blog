					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lahso.megginson.com/2012/08/29/10-years-as-a-pilot/#comment-6024&quot;&gt;Jeff M&lt;/a&gt;.

Great to hear from you, Jeff.  The plane is in good shape, and the paint job is holding up well after ~20 years, so I can tell you and Lachute didn&#039;t cut any corners.  The big changes to the plane are a 4-place intercom (added when I bought it in 2002), a Stormscope (added in 2004), and simple STEC20 autopilot (2011).  

It also has a mostly-new engine â€” the prop tip was struck by lightning in 2005 while sitting on the ramp, and much of the engine was fried, though the rest of the plane, aside from from prop and engine, was fine. The insurance company paid for a new prop and an engine rebuild with mostly new parts, and also for sending the engine mount to Halifax to be degaussed -- the whole thing had become a giant magnet, so that the compass always pointed north. It was down for several months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats David! I was the previous owner of C-FBJO (in Buttonville) - just looking through old photos of her just after we had her painted in La Chute. Googled and am *very* happy to know she has an excellent new home and is doing well. If you are ever in Buttonville with her I&#039;ll buy you a coffee and give her a pat on the nose.... :-)  ! Cheers David! -Jeff M-]]></description>

I originally thought I&#039;d upgrade some day, but the Warrior really is fast enough food my usual flights from Ottawa - average 2:30 for Boston or NYC, 1:45 for Toronto, etc. And there&#039;s a lot to be said for simple, cheap, and idiot-resistant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog! I love the Piper Warrior. As a soon to be private pilot, I am finishing up in one and find it to actually be way easier to fly than a high wing Cessna 172 and more fun to boot. I&#039;m surprised that you did not upgrade to a faster single like a Mooney, Bonanza or Socata but understand these require more to buy, maintain and insure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David I also like the simplicity, reliability and economy that the Piper Warrior provides. I use to fly corporate jets for a living but now that I&#039;m retired my 1983 Warrior N303AV keeps me in the loop. Recently while trying to clear the GA cobwebs from my brain I came upon your blog and many interesting articles. The article you posted on engine leaning was great stimulus for this old cranium. It will really help me get the best performance from my aircraft in flights to come. I restored N303AV in the summer of 2010 and I love the way it handles. ( If I could only get the speed up to 460 knots then it would be perfect :) :)  But that that was then and this is now, so I have to keep it affordable and realistic.  I hope you still have and enjoy your Warrior.  Please continue posting ......and realize your articles are much appreciated.......John Daino]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David:  I just stumbled upon your blog. Some great reading here and some very informative stuff.  Although I have been an aircraft owner for 16 years now, I am only now just working on my instrument ticket and enjoyed reading about some of your early experiences and equipment challenges.  You know the the story of old airplanes, &quot;ya fly &#039;em, ya fix &#039;em, ya fly &#039;em, ya fix &#039;em...&quot;.
I&#039;ve also noticed a lot fewer blogs in 2011 and even fewer in 2012. I hope you will keep them coming in 2013!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow.  It sounds like you&#039;ve got a great set up.  A plane that costs about as much as a second car.  I say yes, you&#039;ll still be flying in ten years.  Also, growing up being able to take family trips in an airplane?  Pretty close to as awesome as it gets.  Maybe if you were an astronaut, and you could head out for a family reunion in space...?
