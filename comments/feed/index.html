Hi, Daphne! So glad it was helpful after all these years. Once he&#039;s started, you might be interested in taking a short &quot;co-pilot&quot; course that will teach you just the basics of handling a plane and landing it in an emergency. You&#039;ll almost certainly never have a serious emergency when you&#039;re flying with your spouse, but the course would help you understand what&#039;s going on when you fly with your spouse, and even help out a bit. 

Who knows? Maybe you&#039;ll like it so much you&#039;ll want to go on and become a licensed pilot, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for explaining that getting a private pilot license means we&#039;ll learn to respect the weather, and even learn how to read what&#039;s not in the forecast. My husband is interested in taking flying lessons soon because he&#039;s always wanted to get a private pilot&#039;s license. I&#039;m glad I read your article because you gave me a good idea of what to expect after he completes his lessons!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Much-belated follow-up on the Spot. I did end up getting one, and it worked well for a number of years. After I upgraded to an IFR GPS (Garmin GTN 650) last summer, however, I was losing signal every ~10 minutes, and the GPS had to reestablish its satellites. It turned out that the 10-minute heartbeat from the Spot was interfering with the WAAS antenna, and that it&#039;s a known issue with the GTN series.  So I didn&#039;t renew my subscription, and the Spot is just sitting in a Rubbermaid container now, with other unused flying stuff.  I might try a Garmin InReach some time soon.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been very happy with my STEC 20, especially because it&#039;s independent of the vacuum system, and can still help me keep the wings level if I&#039;m partial panel.

However, there have been a series of new, affordable autopilots released in 2017—from Garmin and others—that add a lot more functionality for the same price. I&#039;d probably look at those first now, since you have the advantage of a few years of progress.

					<description><![CDATA[Great read David!  I am in the exact same position as you were.  I have a very nicely equipped PA28161 that is in need of an autopilot.  I have looked at all the models, rate-based and attitude-based (my preference), and am truly agonizing over the decision.  Adding to the mix is a slew of new arrivals to the market, though the entry level APs offering purely GPS tracking are of little interest.  I keep coming back to the Stec 20 and am comforted by the fact that it is upgradable.  Glad to hear of your positive experience initially...how has it been since? (N2897M at PiperForum)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely! When I was a student, many years ago, we did a number of experiments to determine the optimum way of presenting information and we found that white figures/needles on a black background worked best. Moreover, we found that, as you state, you remember the position, the picture, not the reading. I have flown a glass cockpit, and I found that the use of strip displays for altitude, speed, etc terribly difficult to interpret, whereas with the old analog instruments the &#039;picture&#039; gave you all the information at a glance, there was no &#039;picture&#039; with the strip gauges, you had to read the numbers and then translate that into what the current state was. So, if I could have a glass cockpit and have the data displayed as analog instruments, I would be happy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must take issue with the description of the aircraft in question being a &quot;private government jet&quot;.  There are 3 categories of civil aircraft in Canada- Private, Commercial, and State. The civilly registered aircraft used by government and military officials are registered under the State category.  Describing them as &quot;private&quot; is incorrect. The other mode available to such officials is aircraft operated by DND, which obviously must be described as &quot;military&quot;, since they are not civilly registered.  If everyone took care to use proper nomenclature, the picture would be much clearer and more accurate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This is what I&#039;m talking about.  Could lean buning at WOT be possible with either the addition of cooled EGR or water injection?  Any thoughts would be appriciated, including the criticizm of those wondering why I&#039;d even think of taking an air-cooled engine and increasing it&#039;s CR to way too high and then leaning it out to way too lean.          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle &#124;&#124; []).push({}); [&#8230;]]]></description>
