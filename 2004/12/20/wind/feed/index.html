					<description><![CDATA[Before I crossed the &quot;pond&quot;, I also presumed that efficiency would be a top concern. However, the experienced ferry pilot I had with me practiced maximum speed upon &quot;feet wet&quot;, to get it over with. Sitting up there, flying along slowly and efficiently is more time for the weather to go bad, stuff to break, etc. You don&#039;t want to be anywhere close to your fuel limits over the Atlantic, have a ferry tank installed if there is the slightest doubt about range.

Aside from that, I think the points about fuel efficiency are very practical for normal US flying.]]></description>
