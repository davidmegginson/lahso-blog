					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This is what I&#039;m talking about.  Could lean buning at WOT be possible with either the addition of cooled EGR or water injection?  Any thoughts would be appriciated, including the criticizm of those wondering why I&#039;d even think of taking an air-cooled engine and increasing it&#039;s CR to way too high and then leaning it out to way too lean.          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle &#124;&#124; []).push({}); [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll be taking a 1983 Warrior II on a 2-3 hour x-c tomorrow, so I&#039;m looking around for some leaning tips (low time pilot).  Since I pay for the rental by the tach hour (wet), what would be the best leaning technique to maximize my rental dollar?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One word of advice, NEVER slam a throttle open, particuluare in a go around situuation it could result in the engine stalling or even stopping, on approach the engine will be on the cold side and &#039;rich&#039; so slamming could cause the engine to &#039;stall&#039; causing a late recovery, yes, a prop will stall just like a wing, need I say more, be carefull and fly smoothly.wing]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lahso.megginson.com/2004/12/23/leaning/#comment-8&quot;&gt;Michael Pusheck&lt;/a&gt;.

Below about fl50 set 75% 2750 and lean, slowly, till you lose 25 revs then enrich back. Job done. Above 5k full throttle and lean for maximum air speed. No harm at this alt as the manifold pressure is &#039;low&#039; due to alitude. Because at this alt the engine may be near the red line it won&#039;t harm as the manifold pressure is low.]]></description>

Always keep your prop smooth with spit and 1200 paper as required. A smooth surface will erode slower profided it&#039;s kept waxed.  It will also provide better air speed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GREAT ARTICAL.. I just sold my plane which utulized a Rotax 912-S (No Mix or Carb Heat required) and am purchasing a Piper 180. I never learned how to adjust either and am researching. Your artical is the 1st that actually explained HOW to make the adjustment rather than just which was better.]]></description>
