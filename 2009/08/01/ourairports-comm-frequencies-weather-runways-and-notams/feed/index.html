					<description><![CDATA[Paul: I replied personally, but missed that this was a comment.  For everyone else&#039;s benefit, the comm frequencies and runways came initially from the old DAFIF, but Paul was kind enough to supply me with a dump of his navaids.com database, which I&#039;ve used to updated many smaller airports.  I&#039;ve used a few other online sources for Australia, the UK, etc.

Ryan: thanks for the comment -- I&#039;ve very happy that you&#039;re finding it useful.  If you&#039;re away from an internet terminal, but still have a satphone or cellphone with a browser, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://ourairports.mobi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OurAirports.mobi&lt;/a&gt; to get text-only pilot info as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I was so impressed with your site &#039;ourairports.com&#039; that I put a few links to pilot info for a couple of airports in Tanzania. Now I have found away to read the weather at home(its not easy in Tanzania).
I also put a link to your blog from my site.

Cheers
