					<description><![CDATA[Wow - just read this.  I played with FS I in high school (&#039;81 or &#039;82), loading it from a cassette, and bought FS II for my Apple ][ Plus in 1984.  I fondly remember that FS II had both a manual for flying and a technical manual that described in quite a bit of detail how the application was written and worked.  It almost seemed like Bruce Artwick was bragging, but in a good way! :)  IIRC, he practically wrote a VM in which to run the program.

I remember learning back then (and in later versions) about instrument flying, and the concepts have helped me with real flying.

If it&#039;s really gone, it is indeed the end of an era.  Bummer.]]></description>
