					<description><![CDATA[From what I gather via newsgroups the airliner was an A320. Flight #1549 from LGA to Charlotte.  I understand it was a birdstrike but was it a double engine failure?  One of the videos I saw this morning showed a passenger talking about the engine on his side bursting into flames but noone mentioned the other engine.  Either way it&#039;s no small feat to ditch an A320 and have everyone walk away!]]></description>
