					<description><![CDATA[Gibraltar&#039;s classification is due to the approach path required for landings from the west side.

[High ground is not the issue, nor is the border as such.]

Due to airspace political reasons, when landing from the west a/c have to make a sharp right hand turn 90+ while on final approach.
So this is the normal approach for landings from the west at GIB.

Political reasons only - the a/c is avoiding nothing more dangeorus or solid than a line on a map (the high terrain of the rock, is in a very safe position with respect to the runway).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As far as I know, none are completely in class A. The surface based part of the CTR is generally Class C or D but in the case of Milan Malpensa 3 parts of the CTR are class A.


Parts of Milano and Roma TMAs are also class A

I sent you an email with the relevant part of the Italian AIP.  You can access most european AIPs for free at http://www.ead.eurocontrol.int (free registration).

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

   As a canadian leaving in Paris, I have to correct you on Le Bourget.

Le Bourget is surrounded by prohibited airspace south of the CTR (Control Zone) and surface-based classe A around it.  The Bourget CTR (Control Zone) is Class D airspace from the ground to 1500 feet MSL.

https://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/aip/enligne/PDF_AIPparSSection/VAC/AD/2/0902_AD-2.LFPB.pdf

Here is the list of European Countries with Class A Control Zones (CTR)
