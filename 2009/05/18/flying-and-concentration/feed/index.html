					<description><![CDATA[David, you should have called.  I could have at least dialed in a radio for ya, saving you that 0.00004% of bandwidth!  What are friends for?  :)  Seriously though, glad to hear you managed to get up there.  I somehow managed to lose my 30 day currency.  Gotta get back at it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true! How incredible that I came across your post today, and thank you for reaffirmation and encouragement. I was practicing holds, procedure turns and approaches today and was having trouble staying un-concentrated. It really is imperative to do so and I&#039;ve become less vigilant about my scan over the past two weeks. I&#039;ll get that fixed before my instrument check- and before I get out there with no instructor to remind me. Thanks!]]></description>
