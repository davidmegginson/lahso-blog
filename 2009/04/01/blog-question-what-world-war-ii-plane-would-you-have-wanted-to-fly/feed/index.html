					<description><![CDATA[Jim: The limited fuel supply in the Spit probably explained the Hurricanes were used for patrolling Luftwaffe airfields in France to intercept bombers taking off.  One advantage of the Hurricane&#039;s fabric on tube construction was that shells often passed right through without exploding, while bullet-damage was easily repaired with fabric patches, while the Spitfire needed to go to a metal shop if it had been shot up much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Paul: When the &quot;other guys&quot; are up there trying to shoot my ass off, I&#039;ll take effective over beauty any day.

Here in Ottawa, the Heritage Wings operation have both a Spit and a Hurricane. The pilots are also split over which ones they prefer to fly, or view as the more effective aircraft.

One of the restrictions that the Spit endured was fuel supply - about 85 gallons I think. The Hurricane had triple the fuel supply. The Spit was primarily a short-range home-defence aircraft - albeit a beautiful, very effective one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember reading that the Hurricanes actually scored more kills than the Spitfires in the Battle of Britain.  However, since the Spitfires often engaged the fighters to let the Hurricanes go after the bombers, it&#039;s not quite fair to compare the two.

I&#039;m not sure, but I think I also remember reading that it&#039;s properly pronounced something like &quot;Hurrigan&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1st choice: P-51D
2nd choice: P-38 Lightning
3rd choice: DeHavilland Mosquito

Of course, I have the benefit of being 24 hours late responding, but besides the two obvious choices (the Spitfire would also rank high in my list), I&#039;ve always loved the Mosquito for too many reasons to list here.

					<description><![CDATA[Nice concept.  I&#039;m looking forward to some interesting replies.  My choice will probably not be the one most popular, but I am partial to it becuase it is a plane that fits my intened lifestyle so well..
1. PBY Catalina
2. C-47
3. Spitfire (no big surpise there .. (actually I&#039;ll easily settle for anything with a Merlin engine)]]></description>
