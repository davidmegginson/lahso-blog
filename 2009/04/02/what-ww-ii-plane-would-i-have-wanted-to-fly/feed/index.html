					<description><![CDATA[Thius Mosquito is indeed a fine choice.  very interesting story behind that bird as you have well brought out.  In England, although I have never heard it in the US, there is an old saying: &quot;An engineer is a chap who can can build for a shilling what any fool can build for a quid.&quot;  The Mosquito certainly provides a little foundation for that sentiment.

There&#039;s also a saying form (I believe) a US designr I always liked: &quot;Simplicate and add lightness&quot;.  In my years maintaining various USAF aircraft I can state pretty categorically that few US designers subscribe to it.

Regarding my PBY choice, if I still lived in the US I doubt it would make it into my top ten, but when you live in a country comprised of 7107 island (maybe more if the Spratley contretemps is ever settled), the Cat just seems a lovely candiate.  Never a shortage of runways ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An old wives tale has it that the piano factories had a bit of trouble with quality control, because they&#039;d never built anything that people&#039;s lives depended on.  So Geoffrey deHavilland instituted a policy that for every first test flight of an aircraft, they&#039;d grab one production line worker at random to ride along.  That got their attention.

I&#039;ve also heard that a Mosquito could carry a bigger bomb load from England to Berlin than a B-17 could.]]></description>
