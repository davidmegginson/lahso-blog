					<description><![CDATA[David,  did you manage to get a full assesment of FBJO?  I hope she&#039;s in tip top shape.  I was most saddened by the gorgeous 182 that used to park right in front of the club.  The one that was front and center for my wedding.  She&#039;s no longer.  It looks like they moved parking spots with someone else and sure enough, were in the path of the tornado.  It always takes a disaster to show the strength of a club and it looks like the RFC came out with full colors flying.  I&#039;m proud to be a part of an orginazation like that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad your plane is safe; we had an instructor and student planning a cross country from CYUL to CYRO that evening; wisely they cancelled. Do you know if the upturned planes were tied down? I once say a 172 here at Trudeau flipped on its back along with its concrete block tie-downs during a wind storm in 2006.]]></description>
