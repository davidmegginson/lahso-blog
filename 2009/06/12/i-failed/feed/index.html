					<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear about that, but I like your attitude about it.

No need to cancel the family trips though - VFR can be done safely and legally in much poorer weather then people give it credit for, especially in the summer months.  I&#039;ve flown my Twin Comanche and other light airplanes VFR all around Southern and Northern Ontario and south of the border a bit (just check OurAirports, lol, I love that app btw), and have very rarely been caught or grounded by weather. Its definitely a different kind of flying, and requires a different mindset, but can be used as an effective travelling tool. I&#039;m not trying to say IFR isn&#039;t superior in most cases during bad weather, but VFR can be used for more then just taking a spin around the patch under blue skies.

At any rate best of luck during your refresh course and following flight test :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh that&#039;s a tall order but I&#039;ll work on becoming more of a hard ass!  I still have the videos for you to review  :)

Wanna add insult to injury?  In the spring of 1976 I was born.  Ok I&#039;ll stop now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David! I guess the best consolance is that you already know that you are a great pilot, it was just minor error(s) that you can correct.  I can&#039;t help but feel for you though as I did not push too hard to go up with you and practice.  So that said I&#039;m going to be on you like white on rice!  (of course assuming you can still practice with a lowly PPL in the right seat).   :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Blake.  You&#039;re exactly right: there&#039;s no opportunity for a retest if your car drifts across the line on the highway head-on into a truck, or your plane flies into a tower. This failure is about nothing more than a piece of paper (though one that I value highly).]]></description>
