					<description><![CDATA[I must take issue with the description of the aircraft in question being a &quot;private government jet&quot;.  There are 3 categories of civil aircraft in Canada- Private, Commercial, and State. The civilly registered aircraft used by government and military officials are registered under the State category.  Describing them as &quot;private&quot; is incorrect. The other mode available to such officials is aircraft operated by DND, which obviously must be described as &quot;military&quot;, since they are not civilly registered.  If everyone took care to use proper nomenclature, the picture would be much clearer and more accurate.]]></description>
