					<description><![CDATA[@JetAviator7, when you &quot;doubt&quot;, are you talking about the present or the past?

There are many wars where people and countries were saved by the US military and its allies.  A few world wars come to mind immediately, but many other smaller conflicts probably also qualify, unless you define &quot;saved&quot; way down.

As for now, who knows?  The present wars have liberated millions from  dictatorships; the question is whether it can last, whether the people can &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; saved.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Frank -- you saved me the correction.  South Vietnam was a dictatorship that (especially under Diem and his massacres) made Egypt and Libya look like Switzerland -- not that the North was a paradise, either, of course.  

The Vietnam War had two components: a conventional military invasion from the North (the North Vietnamese army), and a guerilla anti-government insurgency in the South (Viet Cong).  The US intervention, whether justified or not, left 60,000 American soldiers and somewhere between 200,000 and 2M Southeast Asian civilians dead, a tragedy of mind-numbing proportions for the region &#8212; imagine 100 to 1,000 consecutive 9/11 attacks, in an area with a fraction of the US population.  

Most Vietnamese alive today were born after the war, and I suspect the person who posted that comment must be among the young.  It&#039;s hard to imagine anyone who actually lived through the war &#8212; no matter what side he or she supported then, and no matter how much he or she likes the US now &#8212; wanting to see American solidiers back in Vietnam.  The memories would just be too painful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are of course entitled to filter comments however you see fit on your web site.  However ...

&quot;The United States — saviour of the Vietnamese people?&quot;

It sounds ironic, but it really isn&#039;t.  The US fought to help a democratic nation filled with real live vietnamese people from communist invasion.  The fight was not successful, and resulted in a lot of suffering for the subjected people and a lot of death nearby (ask Aviatrix).  So, can we agree at least to &quot;attempted saviour&quot;?

And regarding weapons, effective self-defense against armed opponents requires weapons.  There is not much point making some sort of moral judgment about weapons per se,  as opposed to their employment in particular circumstances.]]></description>
