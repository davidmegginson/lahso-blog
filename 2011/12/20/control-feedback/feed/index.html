					<description><![CDATA[Hey David

I found your blog via &quot;Cockpit Conversation&quot;, and quickly wanted to reply;
I actually am not quite sure on why the inputs are averaged, though I&#039;m sure a quick google search would yield a lot of answers;
But I do know that (I&#039;m not a professional pilot, just a flightsimmer with too much time virtually in the A320 series)

Airbus has a &quot;Sidestick Priority&quot; feature. It&#039;s a small button on both joysticks. Pressing it deactivates the autopilot, and gives control priority to whoever pushes the button (So the plane disregards input from the other side stick.) If the button is pressed for more than 30 seconds, it becomes latched, and the stick will keep priority even if the button is released.
Pressing either button again disconnects the priority in this case.

To ensure both pilots know who has priority, both of them have a small annunciator light with an arrow pointing to the other side of the cockpit, together with a voice warning.
http://www.airliners.net/photo/319771/L/ Top right shows a good example of the side stick priority.

Hope it helps atleast a little!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In learning to fly I noticed the best flight instructors kept their hand on the &quot;joy&quot; stick, wheel or yoke.  When I began instructing in airplanes I, too, would follow the student&#039;s control movements,  thereby anticipating the aircraft&#039;s changes. After a few years I realized I &quot;tracked&quot; even the pilots of 4 engine aircraft if I were the assigned copilot.  If the àssigned pilot believed he was a superior pilot to me he might reveal offensiveness, but if he or she were truly superior or obviously inferior he would not show such an attitude.
