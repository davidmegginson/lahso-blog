					<description><![CDATA[Excellent site. I&#039;ve just updated my profile to include all 50 of my airports (wow, in less than 3 years!). Great effort. I&#039;ve also placed a posting on several aviation forums to see if I can help drum up some visits for you.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, XingR.  You&#039;re right -- it&#039;s better to be too busy than to be sitting around wondering where the visitors are.  The site&#039;s already up to 108 comments (and hundreds of airports marked visited), which isn&#039;t bad for the first 24 hours after low-key launch on a dodgy server.  The hardest part is switching my brain back to my paid consulting work for my customers, or even switching it off to sleep.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are two main things to worry about when you invest time and resources in an internet service.

It will be a flop, and no one will come.

Or it will be a success and the server(s) will grumble and cause sleepless nights.

Of the two the latter is probably the much preferable, but it may not feel that way at the time.

Be of good cheer, I&#039;m sure it will sort itself out before long and I think the concept is neat, I hope a lot of other people do too.]]></description>
