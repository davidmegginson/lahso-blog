					<description><![CDATA[Thank you both.

XingR: The first announcement was July 17, so it has been 11 days now.

Nick: Right now, I&#039;m happy to receive suggestions either way, though e-mail is probably the best choice.  When the site gets busier, I&#039;ll add some kind of more formal feedback system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pretty cool when success pops up an bites a site, isn&#039;t it?  When you just write a blog or have a static website, people either visit or they don&#039;t and as long as the pages serve nothing else matters much.  But when you have interactive users ... ahhh then you find out how well you can think ahead.  I never would have thought of that issue, sounds like your solution is quite workable.

What day did you actually kick this site off?  Only about 10 days ago, wasn&#039;t it?  I said, it will be successful but I had absolutely no basis for that statement except a gut reaction ... I&#039;m glad it wasn&#039;t just indigestion talking.]]></description>
