					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments and bug reports.  I can&#039;t reproduce the off-by-one visitor count error, but I&#039;ll keep watching for it.  I did find the broken sign-in link on the home page and fixed it.

Bulk airport entry is on my TODO list, but there are still a few higher priorities.  The next thing to appear (other than the many bug fixes and code cleanups that you can&#039;t see) will probably either be (a) identifying your home airport (and seeing a list of who calls each airport home), or (b) being able to reply to a comment rather than having to start a new one with the same title.  A little bit into the longer term, I&#039;d like to let members communicate directly with each other.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, that&#039;s really cool. I entered a bunch of airports. Wait until I have all my logbooks in one place and can get them all. Who knew that that was all it would take to get Aviatrix to reveal her whereabouts.

It took me a while to figure out how to add airports. After all, I wasn&#039;t searching, I knew where they were. Can I add airports as a comma-separated list somehow, so I don&#039;t have to keep hitting search?

I wouldn&#039;t mind like an option to connect the dots in order to see what it all spells. I tried doing that on a map of one province once.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The site is great! I, too, was hoping for a way to distinguish between airports I&#039;d flown to and airports that I&#039;d been flown to.

Looking at other people&#039;s maps sure was humbling. I still have a couple to add when I have a chance to check my logbook, but boy, are my flights ever local. Farthest south: Columbus, OH. Farthest west: Columbus, OH. Lewis or Clark, I ain&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Tony.  A lot of people have requested that feature, and it&#039;s one of my top priorities, once I catch up on my consulting work for my customers.

Gerry Thompson at the Ottawa Flying Club is a DFTE, so I always do my IFR flight test with him (even though I&#039;m not an OFC member any more).  We did a hold at YOW, the VOR/DME 09 full procecure at CYND, and the ILS 32 at CYOW, which is pretty-much the normal pattern for an IFR flight test out of CYOW.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First - congrats on the IFR renewal, I did mine in Cornwall two weeks ago.  Who was your examiner, and which approaches did you do?

I was preparing a quick list of suggestions for you - #1 on the list was a means to identify whether you were the pilot when you landed at that airport, or were you a passenger on a commercial flight?]]></description>
