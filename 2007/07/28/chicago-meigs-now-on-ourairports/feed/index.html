					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d have phrased it &quot;Toronto re-elects David Miller.  Good luck, you&#039;ll need it&quot; personally.  ;-)

(BTW David, this input window is a bit too wide and is overlapping the archives listings.  Just FYI)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Putting &quot;David Miller&quot; and &quot;good luck&quot; in the same sentence just doesn&#039;t look right. Unless the sentence goes something like this &quot;The people of Toronto have finally awaken and booted David Miller out of office. This, of course, is good luck for not only the aviation community but also each and every taxpayer.&quot;

Darn! That&#039;s two sentences! :-)
