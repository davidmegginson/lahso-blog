					<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,

I have just come across DavidÂ´s blog and I have to say itÂ´s interesting to see the differences in each country. I live and work in Spain and it can also get frustrating at times and the beaurocracy is special here (they love their paperwork - computers are just for show!). I think it is a good idea for pilots to try to gain valuable experience by flying in as many other countries as possible.

Anyway, keep up the good work David.

Regards

Mike]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jason: I wondered the same thing, because most of the time, I get through no problem.  However, it&#039;s already failed me a couple of times when I really needed it (I mentioned one in the posting).

I think I&#039;m not getting the full L-M system, yet -- some pilots in the south get an automated system asking them for their state, while I always get the NY International Flight Services Station (maybe because of my foreign area code).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, especially when the transition to Lockheed first took place FSS was really in bad shape.  We had to wait 15 minutes on hold once to close a VFR flight plan.

However, I&#039;ve used it a few times in the last month and had a good experience - very little if any time on hold.

Maybe I&#039;ve just been getting lucky.  :)]]></description>
