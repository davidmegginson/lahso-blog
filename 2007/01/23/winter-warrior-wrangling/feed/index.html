					<description><![CDATA[Something else you could do to plug in the engine heater is run the cord in through the front of the cowling (make sure it doesn&#039;t droop onto the engine if it&#039;s still hot).  Or if you don&#039;t really care about possibly bending the sheetmetal door slightly, run it into the door normally and latch one (what I usually do) or both latches.

Concerning winching it back by the tiedown, I know a few people at my airport that do this, and as far as I know they haven&#039;t had any problems, even the ones with Cessnas (which have a wimpy small tiedown ring, as opposed to the tank-like one Piper uses).  The mechanics at the FBO I work at also use the tiedown to pull the tail down if they have to work on the nosewheels of our Warriors, which I know is about 90 degrees different than pulling it backwards, but still should say something about the strength of those things.  Actually, I think I&#039;ll ask them about this when I&#039;m there next.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I’m starting to think about buying a boat winch and using it to pull the plane back by its tail tiedown.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;ve seen discussions of this and some claim the tiedown is not designed for this. Consider roping the winch to your main gear.]]></description>
