					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Aviatrix.  That makes me think of the incident out of Buttonville a couple of years ago.  A flight instructor took a family up for a site-seeing flight in a Cessna, failed to identify a carb icing problem, and lost her engine.  She made up for that, though, with a brilliant landing from low altitude over Markham, which has no empty space to speak of &#8212; she found a bit of green on the front lawn of IBM Canada, flared the plane, and stalled it right over (and into) a tiny bunch of trees.  Everyone walked away, with only minor scrapes (this is from memory, so apologies for any errors).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an absolutely prize-winning photo. And a good demonstration of the fact that you don&#039;t need an especially good landing spot to survive an engine failure, as long as you maintain control of the aircraft at best glide speed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The most amazing thing about this picture is that the unfortunate pilot managed to find that tree to roost in.  The trees around Meadowlake ... of that size ... are mighty few and far between.

A friend has a ranch about 5 miles due south of the airport, 11 miles east of the Colorado Springs city limit sign.  Road directions to reach his ranch are as simple as, &quot;Go Eats on Colorado 94 to the first tree and turn left.&quot;  The trees are really that far apart  out there on the plains.

Glad he came out of it ok but it is a strange one.]]></description>
