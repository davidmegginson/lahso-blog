					<description><![CDATA[Ask if they will ship via USPS instead of UPS/FedEx, etc.   Via the postal system there are no rediculous brokerage fees, and occasionally even the duties are skipped if customs doesn&#039;t happen to open the package.

Simply pickup at the post office and pay the GST and a small processing fee.

I won&#039;t buy from any US company that will not ship USPS - I was stung once by the UPS gouge, and never again will I fall prey to that rediculous charge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I second the cheers for Sutton Aviation.  Some years ago, a kind AME gentleman there very quickly, and absurdly cheaply, repaired a C172 wingtip fairing.  I had intimately introduced it to the museum&#039;s hangar doors.

Every time I&#039;ve been to CYRO since, I&#039;ve looked for him to say thanks again, but haven&#039;t been able to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s tempting to rent a mailbox at the UPS store just across the bridge in Ogdensburg NY (an hour&#039;s drive from Ottawa).  I&#039;d have to pay some GST at the border, but I&#039;d get parts much faster that way.  I could even fly down, if the FBO has a crew car I could use (or if I felt like the walk from the airport to the store).]]></description>
