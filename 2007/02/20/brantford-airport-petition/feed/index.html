					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post David, I have duly signed the petition.  My partner and I have our Cardinal based there... had been flying the BFC&#039;s Cutlass for a while before that.  It&#039;s a great airport - and has got a lot going for it.  It&#039;s a real publice treasure.  It would be areal tragedy for the airport to get closed down.

Your interesting post sparked an idea,  how about starting a move to have the airport renamed?  The Alexander Graham Bell Airport!  That could help cement the public&#039;s attachment for ever.  Maybe someday there could be a museum built to show the origins of flight?

Cheers,

					<description><![CDATA[Good call on the part about Bell: that had never occurred to me!  I&#039;ll try to work it into our upcoming aviation.ca article somehow.  Thanks very much for your support.
