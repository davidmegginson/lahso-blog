					<description><![CDATA[You probably missed the line stating that I borrowed a loaner battery from the shop for the New York trip.

That said, a plane will keep flying fine with no battery and a failed alternator, since the spark plugs are driven by two redundant magnetos; in fact, there are still planes flying that don&#039;t use batteries and have to be started by hand propping.  Granted, the loss of the electrical system would cause awkwardness in controlled airspace (I&#039;d have to talk to ATC on my handheld radio or cell phone), and would be a serious risk in IMC (since I&#039;d have no backup to the vacuum pump).

On a nice VFR day, I would not hesitate to fly a plane with a weak battery back home for repair (assuming I could get a boost to start the plane).  I wouldn&#039;t knowingly fly outbound in that condition, or fly at night or in IMC or marginal VMC.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not sure what they used at Mr.Lube but they attached both ends to my battery and stated that it was running at 85 percent capacity. They &quot;as in high school kid&quot; said that as your battery looses its charge over time the alternator works harder to charge and run the systems. He showed me this device but how does it work ? I mean you have Voltage or you don&#039;t, can it figure out how many coloumbs of charge you have sitting in it ?]]></description>
