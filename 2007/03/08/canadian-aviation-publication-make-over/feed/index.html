					<description><![CDATA[Hey David,

 I find when you look at it the way it all contrasts makes it hard to focus on the writing. Its like looking at one of those pictures that can look like a beautiful lady or an old one.

As for what they can do to make things better. Make a GPS overlay for all approaches so that when commencing an ILS approach the IF, FAF, and MAP are in the gps for reference and also displayed on the EFIS. The Garmin 530 does this but the KLN90 just has GNSS overlays and not all approaches.

Cheers,

FD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually like having just one guide for all of Canada, instead of juggling all the thin Airport/Facility Directories like I have to in the U.S.  And the sad thing is that it probably wouldn&#039;t be any cheaper if it were thinner -- just compare the price of Canadian VNCs with U.S. sectionals.]]></description>
