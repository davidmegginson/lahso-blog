					<description><![CDATA[Niss: don&#039;t forget the $0.11/litre you pay in a special fuel tax to support air traffic services (though when the feds spun off Nav Canada, they decided to hang on to the tax).  If you burn 2,000 litres/year, that works out to another $220/year that&#039;s at least &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to help pay for the system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe if airlines actually charged enough money to cover costs and didn&#039;t try to out do each other with cheap fares this wouldn&#039;t be such a problem.

If GA is &quot;free loading&quot; off the airlines what services are we free loading ? I can think of one comparison....the same reason I can download AVG for home-non profit use while a &quot;business&quot; has to purchase it to do the same purpose. The business is using it in its quest for profit much as airlines use airports and ATC. Can&#039;t compare apples to oranges but and I understand competition in the industry but its the cost of doing business so quit your bitchin airlines :)

Maybe the Canadian government can give our 55 dollar &quot;medical&quot; fee to airports or Navcanada to take the &quot;burden&quot; of offering us a service that they are in the business of providing !]]></description>
